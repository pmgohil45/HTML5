1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,05
(bright electronic music)

2
00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:07,01
- [Instructor] We've been working with basic transforms

3
00:00:07,01 --> 00:00:09,09
and transitions, so for a nice follow-up challenge,

4
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:11,04
let's add an additional transition

5
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:13,07
to the button we were just working on.

6
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:15,09
You can use the files that you've already been using

7
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:19,02
or the exercise files I provided for this challenge.

8
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:20,07
This is a nice short challenge.

9
00:00:20,07 --> 00:00:22,05
You should spend about five minutes or so

10
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:24,04
adjusting your additional transition

11
00:00:24,04 --> 00:00:27,00
and then watch the solution to see what I came up with.
