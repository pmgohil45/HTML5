1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,05
(upbeat music begins)

2
00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:06,08
- [Narrator] For my solution,

3
00:00:06,08 --> 00:00:08,07
I added an additional transition

4
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:10,02
to the border radius property,

5
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:13,05
so my hover now looks like this.

6
00:00:13,05 --> 00:00:16,09
To show you what I did, I'll go back to my CSS file.

7
00:00:16,09 --> 00:00:20,02
And what I did was add a border radius of 20 pixels

8
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:22,00
to the button's hover styles.

9
00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:23,08
And then I added an additional property

10
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:26,00
to the transition for border radius.

11
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:28,03
I gave it a duration of 0.3 seconds,

12
00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:29,09
just like our background color,

13
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:32,04
and the same easing of ease in like our background color,

14
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:33,07
just to have a couple of things

15
00:00:33,07 --> 00:00:36,01
line up with the same timing and easing.

16
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:39,03
And then the end result is what we saw here.

17
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:40,07
And there we have a hover effect

18
00:00:40,07 --> 00:00:42,06
with one more transitioning property,

19
00:00:42,06 --> 00:00:45,00
and some practice with CSS transitions.
