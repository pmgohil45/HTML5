00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:02,04
- [Narrator] CSS transitions are one of the ways

2
00:00:02,04 --> 00:00:04,03
we can create animation with CSS

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:07,00
even though they're not called animations.

4
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:08,08
It's confusing, but true.

5
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:12,03
By definition, animation means causing change over time

6
00:00:12,03 --> 00:00:14,09
and transitions absolutely do that.

7
00:00:14,09 --> 00:00:16,04
They just do it in a different way

8
00:00:16,04 --> 00:00:19,06
then CSS key frame animations do.

9
00:00:19,06 --> 00:00:21,00
Let's start with creating a button

10
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:22,06
that transforms on hover

11
00:00:22,06 --> 00:00:26,07
to take a quick look at what CSS transitions can do.

12
00:00:26,07 --> 00:00:28,07
Transitions need a beginning and end state

13
00:00:28,07 --> 00:00:31,05
to transition between, that's why we tend to use them

14
00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:34,00
for things like hover states.

15
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:35,06
The initial styles on our element,

16
00:00:35,06 --> 00:00:38,02
like what we're seeing here, are the beginning state

17
00:00:38,02 --> 00:00:41,07
and the hover states we define end up being our end state.

18
00:00:41,07 --> 00:00:45,06
So let's start by defining our hover state first.

19
00:00:45,06 --> 00:00:50,04
We'll go to our CSS and a hover state for our button

20
00:00:50,04 --> 00:00:52,04
and on hover, I'd like to have this button

21
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:55,04
both grow a little bit and change color.

22
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:58,02
So we'll add a transform

23
00:00:58,02 --> 00:01:01,01
with a scale to have that growing

24
00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:04,04
and we'll make it 1.3 so it'll grow just a little bit

25
00:01:04,04 --> 00:01:07,04
and we'll add a background color to change the color,

26
00:01:07,04 --> 00:01:10,00
and I'm going to change this to that same purple

27
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:12,01
that we have on the border of the button.

28
00:01:12,01 --> 00:01:14,06
And then to make sure we have good contrast,

29
00:01:14,06 --> 00:01:21,09
I will also change the color of the text.

30
00:01:21,09 --> 00:01:26,07
So if we save that in preview our page now,

31
00:01:26,07 --> 00:01:29,06
we have our hover state but it's just a hard cut

32
00:01:29,06 --> 00:01:31,07
to those change properties.

33
00:01:31,07 --> 00:01:35,05
There's no nice animated change that we wanted to see.

34
00:01:35,05 --> 00:01:38,01
So let's go back to our CSS and add a transition

35
00:01:38,01 --> 00:01:42,00
to smooth things out.

36
00:01:42,00 --> 00:01:45,01
We apply the transition property to our button directly.

37
00:01:45,01 --> 00:01:47,03
It's kind of like we're setting a property to say,

38
00:01:47,03 --> 00:01:50,05
hey button, if any of your properties happen to change

39
00:01:50,05 --> 00:01:53,08
in the future, here's how you should handle it.

40
00:01:53,08 --> 00:01:57,05
So add a transition to our button and the minimum we need

41
00:01:57,05 --> 00:01:59,05
for a transition is a duration,

42
00:01:59,05 --> 00:02:03,04
so we'll set the duration to 0.5 seconds here.

43
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:05,04
This is probably a good time to stop and note

44
00:02:05,04 --> 00:02:07,09
that we can use both seconds or milliseconds

45
00:02:07,09 --> 00:02:09,08
for durations in CSS.

46
00:02:09,08 --> 00:02:12,06
Milliseconds are one one thousandth of a second,

47
00:02:12,06 --> 00:02:16,07
so 0.5 seconds is the same as 500 milliseconds

48
00:02:16,07 --> 00:02:19,06
and 500 milliseconds is the same as 0.5 seconds.

49
00:02:19,06 --> 00:02:22,01
In most cases, it's just a matter of preference

50
00:02:22,01 --> 00:02:25,02
as far as which one you prefer to use.

51
00:02:25,02 --> 00:02:27,03
So if we save this and go back and preview our button

52
00:02:27,03 --> 00:02:31,01
once more, we can see a nice smooth transition when we hover

53
00:02:31,01 --> 00:02:33,03
on and off our button.

54
00:02:33,03 --> 00:02:35,08
Notice how setting that single transition

55
00:02:35,08 --> 00:02:38,09
animates both the movement into the hover,

56
00:02:38,09 --> 00:02:41,00
as well as back to the initial properties

57
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:43,06
when we hover off the button.

58
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:45,06
Right now, both our changing properties

59
00:02:45,06 --> 00:02:47,07
are transitioning at the same time,

60
00:02:47,07 --> 00:02:49,07
but we can have even more granular control

61
00:02:49,07 --> 00:02:52,04
over our transition effects by giving each property

62
00:02:52,04 --> 00:02:56,01
its own transition values.

63
00:02:56,01 --> 00:02:57,09
So let's first assign a transition

64
00:02:57,09 --> 00:02:59,06
to just our background property.

65
00:02:59,06 --> 00:03:03,00
We can have that take 0.3 seconds and give it an easing

66
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:06,00
of ease-in.

67
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:08,01
Then we comma separate the transitions

68
00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:10,06
for our separate properties and we can go

69
00:03:10,06 --> 00:03:13,01
and have a separate transition defined

70
00:03:13,01 --> 00:03:16,00
for our transform properties.

71
00:03:16,00 --> 00:03:17,08
And we'll have this one take slightly less time

72
00:03:17,08 --> 00:03:24,06
of 0.2 seconds and give it an easing of ease-in-out.

73
00:03:24,06 --> 00:03:26,03
When you're writing multiple transforms,

74
00:03:26,03 --> 00:03:29,06
make sure to comma separate the different rules.

75
00:03:29,06 --> 00:03:33,03
Now, when we save and preview our button one more time

76
00:03:33,03 --> 00:03:35,07
our background color and scale transform

77
00:03:35,07 --> 00:03:40,02
change at slightly different rates.

78
00:03:40,02 --> 00:03:41,04
Just by separating out

79
00:03:41,04 --> 00:03:43,07
these two different transitioning properties,

80
00:03:43,07 --> 00:03:46,08
we've created a slightly more nuanced effect.

81
00:03:46,08 --> 00:03:48,05
Transitions can also be delayed,

82
00:03:48,05 --> 00:03:49,09
so let's add a delay to just one

83
00:03:49,09 --> 00:03:52,05
of our transitioning properties to see how that changes

84
00:03:52,05 --> 00:03:54,03
the look of things.

85
00:03:54,03 --> 00:03:56,01
In the short hand notation I'm using,

86
00:03:56,01 --> 00:03:58,04
the second time-based value will be used

87
00:03:58,04 --> 00:04:00,01
as the transition delay.

88
00:04:00,01 --> 00:04:03,03
So I'll add a 0.1 second delay to the transition

89
00:04:03,03 --> 00:04:05,07
on our transform property.

90
00:04:05,07 --> 00:04:09,00
So this first time-based value, the 0.2 seconds,

91
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:11,00
is our duration for our transition

92
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:14,02
and that second time-based value, the 0.1 seconds,

93
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:17,07
is the delay for our transform transition.

94
00:04:17,07 --> 00:04:22,06
So we'll save that and preview our button one more time.

95
00:04:22,06 --> 00:04:24,09
And now we can see that our scale transform

96
00:04:24,09 --> 00:04:26,09
starts transitioning just a little bit

97
00:04:26,09 --> 00:04:31,03
after our background color starts changing.

98
00:04:31,03 --> 00:04:33,01
So that's the basics of how we can create

99
00:04:33,01 --> 00:04:36,07
some simple state-based animation with CSS transitions.

100
00:04:36,07 --> 00:04:39,01
There are a whole lot of interesting animated effects

101
00:04:39,01 --> 00:04:41,00
you can make with transitions.
