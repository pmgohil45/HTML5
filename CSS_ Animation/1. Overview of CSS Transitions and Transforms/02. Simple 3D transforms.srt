00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,08
- [Instructor] One of the most interesting things

2
00:00:01,08 --> 00:00:05,00
about CSS transforms is how easily they allow us

3
00:00:05,00 --> 00:00:07,06
to create the effect of 3D.

4
00:00:07,06 --> 00:00:08,08
I'll be touching on the basics

5
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:10,08
of 3D transforms in this video,

6
00:00:10,08 --> 00:00:13,03
but there are other CSS courses in the library

7
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:16,03
that cover this in much more depth as well.

8
00:00:16,03 --> 00:00:17,07
Getting to 3D in CSS

9
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:19,09
can be as straightforward as just rotating

10
00:00:19,09 --> 00:00:21,07
around the x or y-axis.

11
00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:24,00
Doing that angles part of the object

12
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:25,06
on screen away from you

13
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:28,04
and that makes you get a 3D effect.

14
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:30,09
I'll use this robot image to demonstrate.

15
00:00:30,09 --> 00:00:33,07
It's just an image sitting in a HTML page,

16
00:00:33,07 --> 00:00:37,05
but I can still apply 3D transforms to it.

17
00:00:37,05 --> 00:00:38,08
In my CSS file,

18
00:00:38,08 --> 00:00:41,03
I'll add a transform rule to our robot image.

19
00:00:41,03 --> 00:00:43,00
So we will transform this

20
00:00:43,00 --> 00:00:50,07
and we will give it a rotation on the x-axis of 45 degrees.

21
00:00:50,07 --> 00:00:54,03
In browsers, the x-axis is the one that runs horizontally,

22
00:00:54,03 --> 00:00:57,04
so it's essentially like we are rotating around a pole

23
00:00:57,04 --> 00:01:00,03
going through the middle of this image.

24
00:01:00,03 --> 00:01:04,00
If we save this and preview it in our browser,

25
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:06,08
it may not be exactly what you were expecting.

26
00:01:06,08 --> 00:01:08,06
It looks a little bit misshapen

27
00:01:08,06 --> 00:01:11,02
and not quite right just yet.

28
00:01:11,02 --> 00:01:13,02
To get 3D transforms to look right

29
00:01:13,02 --> 00:01:15,00
or at least as we expect,

30
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:17,04
we need to add some perspective.

31
00:01:17,04 --> 00:01:18,09
Going back to our CSS,

32
00:01:18,09 --> 00:01:21,06
there are two places we can add perspective.

33
00:01:21,06 --> 00:01:24,02
We could add it to the transform rule itself

34
00:01:24,02 --> 00:01:28,01
or we can set the perspective property on a parent element.

35
00:01:28,01 --> 00:01:30,06
I prefer to set this on the parent element.

36
00:01:30,06 --> 00:01:33,05
That way if I decide to add any additional elements

37
00:01:33,05 --> 00:01:35,02
for 3D transforms later,

38
00:01:35,02 --> 00:01:37,01
they'll use the same perspective setting.

39
00:01:37,01 --> 00:01:38,07
So I'll go up to my parent element

40
00:01:38,07 --> 00:01:42,03
which in this case happens to be my body

41
00:01:42,03 --> 00:01:50,02
and I will add a perspective of 1,000 pixels.

42
00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:53,03
The perspective length can be set in pixels or ems

43
00:01:53,03 --> 00:01:55,04
and it represents an approximation

44
00:01:55,04 --> 00:01:58,09
of how far away you are from the transforming element.

45
00:01:58,09 --> 00:02:01,02
Lower values show a more drastic effect

46
00:02:01,02 --> 00:02:03,08
and higher values show a flatter effect.

47
00:02:03,08 --> 00:02:08,03
So if we save and preview our 1,000-pixel perspective,

48
00:02:08,03 --> 00:02:10,01
the rotation looks a little bit

49
00:02:10,01 --> 00:02:11,04
more like you were expecting.

50
00:02:11,04 --> 00:02:16,00
We get that kind of 45-degree lean back feel to it.

51
00:02:16,00 --> 00:02:18,08
To contrast, take a look at what that same rotation

52
00:02:18,08 --> 00:02:21,06
looks like with a 100-pixel perspective.

53
00:02:21,06 --> 00:02:27,05
So if we go back and change our 1,000 pixels to 100 pixels,

54
00:02:27,05 --> 00:02:30,04
the effect is much more dramatic.

55
00:02:30,04 --> 00:02:33,06
Rotating around the y-axis will get you a similar result

56
00:02:33,06 --> 00:02:37,00
as just rotating on the up and down or vertical axis,

57
00:02:37,00 --> 00:02:39,02
and you can also rotate around both the x

58
00:02:39,02 --> 00:02:42,05
and y-axis for a combined effect.

59
00:02:42,05 --> 00:02:45,00
So we can add an additional rotation

60
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:47,05
on the y-axis of 20 degrees

61
00:02:47,05 --> 00:02:49,05
and I will also go back and change that perspective

62
00:02:49,05 --> 00:02:51,03
to 1,000 instead of 100

63
00:02:51,03 --> 00:02:53,08
so we can be a little bit less drastic.

64
00:02:53,08 --> 00:02:55,08
When I save and refresh that,

65
00:02:55,08 --> 00:02:58,05
you can see we have rotation on both the x and y-axis

66
00:02:58,05 --> 00:03:00,02
and we've transformed this robot

67
00:03:00,02 --> 00:03:03,03
a little bit more within 3D space.

68
00:03:03,03 --> 00:03:05,06
You can also move objects in 3D space

69
00:03:05,06 --> 00:03:07,09
using the translate3d function.

70
00:03:07,09 --> 00:03:10,03
The translate3d function takes three numbers,

71
00:03:10,03 --> 00:03:15,05
one for each of the x, y, and z-axes.

72
00:03:15,05 --> 00:03:17,02
So if we go back to our CSS,

73
00:03:17,02 --> 00:03:20,04
we can add a translate3d

74
00:03:20,04 --> 00:03:25,04
and we can move our robot say 100 pixels on the x-axis,

75
00:03:25,04 --> 00:03:27,09
200 pixels down on the y-axis,

76
00:03:27,09 --> 00:03:31,08
and minus 100 pixels on the z-axis.

77
00:03:31,08 --> 00:03:33,04
So essentially what this will do

78
00:03:33,04 --> 00:03:36,05
is move our robot slightly over to the right by 100 pixels,

79
00:03:36,05 --> 00:03:39,07
slightly down by 200 pixels on the y-axis,

80
00:03:39,07 --> 00:03:41,04
and slightly back in space

81
00:03:41,04 --> 00:03:44,01
with that negative 100 pixels on the z-axis.

82
00:03:44,01 --> 00:03:47,02
So if we save and preview our robot now,

83
00:03:47,02 --> 00:03:49,09
it kind of looks like our image just got smaller.

84
00:03:49,09 --> 00:03:52,07
It should, it's further away from us now,

85
00:03:52,07 --> 00:03:54,07
but it's difficult to see that distance

86
00:03:54,07 --> 00:03:57,08
when we just have one object on screen.

87
00:03:57,08 --> 00:04:00,07
Translations like this are much more visually effective

88
00:04:00,07 --> 00:04:02,04
when they're animated or transitioned

89
00:04:02,04 --> 00:04:06,06
so we can see that movement backward into space.

90
00:04:06,06 --> 00:04:09,08
So that's a dust a short look at what CSS transforms can do

91
00:04:09,08 --> 00:04:12,00
to give us a look of 3D space.
