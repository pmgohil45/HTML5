00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,05
- [Instructor] Transforms, transitions, and animations

2
00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:04,07
are all things that CSS can do,

3
00:00:04,07 --> 00:00:06,01
but their names are so similar

4
00:00:06,01 --> 00:00:08,07
they can sometimes be confusing.

5
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:10,04
All three terms sound like

6
00:00:10,04 --> 00:00:12,04
they could possibly make things move,

7
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:15,01
but not all three of them do.

8
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:18,07
The focus of this course is on CSS keyframe animation.

9
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:19,08
But since all three of these

10
00:00:19,08 --> 00:00:22,04
are frequently used together in web animation,

11
00:00:22,04 --> 00:00:26,04
we'll cover transforms and transitions briefly as well.

12
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,03
Let's dive into transforms first.

13
00:00:29,03 --> 00:00:33,00
I like to think of these as the yoga of CSS.

14
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:34,09
We can use them to bend and twist

15
00:00:34,09 --> 00:00:37,04
those flat rectangular HTML objects

16
00:00:37,04 --> 00:00:40,06
into all sorts of configurations.

17
00:00:40,06 --> 00:00:42,05
I'll use this robot image here

18
00:00:42,05 --> 00:00:46,01
to demonstrate some of the things that transforms can do.

19
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:48,01
Transforms are often used to translate

20
00:00:48,01 --> 00:00:50,09
or move an object around the browser window,

21
00:00:50,09 --> 00:00:52,07
so we'll start with that.

22
00:00:52,07 --> 00:00:54,07
For example, in our CSS,

23
00:00:54,07 --> 00:00:58,01
we can apply a transform of a translation to our robot

24
00:00:58,01 --> 00:01:00,02
to move it slightly across the screen.

25
00:01:00,02 --> 00:01:03,00
So we'll add a transform

26
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:05,03
of a translation on the x-axis

27
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:08,02
and we'll move this image 300 pixels to the right

28
00:01:08,02 --> 00:01:09,02
on the x-axis.

29
00:01:09,02 --> 00:01:11,05
The x-axis is the horizontal one.

30
00:01:11,05 --> 00:01:16,05
So when we save this and go back to refresh our browser,

31
00:01:16,05 --> 00:01:17,08
we'll see that our robot image

32
00:01:17,08 --> 00:01:21,08
has moved 300 pixels to the right.

33
00:01:21,08 --> 00:01:24,01
Translations can take other units as well,

34
00:01:24,01 --> 00:01:26,09
like amps and percentages, for example.

35
00:01:26,09 --> 00:01:28,08
But know that for transforms,

36
00:01:28,08 --> 00:01:31,06
the percentage refers to the object itself,

37
00:01:31,06 --> 00:01:33,01
not as container.

38
00:01:33,01 --> 00:01:35,01
So if we go back to our CSS

39
00:01:35,01 --> 00:01:39,09
and change that 300 pixels to 100%,

40
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:43,01
when we save and refresh our page once more,

41
00:01:43,01 --> 00:01:45,04
we'll see that our robot has moved to the right

42
00:01:45,04 --> 00:01:47,09
the equivalent distance of its own width,

43
00:01:47,09 --> 00:01:50,05
which happens to be slightly less than 300 pixels

44
00:01:50,05 --> 00:01:53,03
in this particular case.

45
00:01:53,03 --> 00:01:56,02
We can also translate on both the x and y-axes

46
00:01:56,02 --> 00:01:58,00
by using the translate function

47
00:01:58,00 --> 00:02:00,00
and giving it two coordinates.

48
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:01,00
So for example,

49
00:02:01,00 --> 00:02:04,06
we can change this translate x to just translate

50
00:02:04,06 --> 00:02:06,00
and then give it two numbers:

51
00:02:06,00 --> 00:02:09,03
the first one for the translation on the x-axis

52
00:02:09,03 --> 00:02:12,02
and the second for the translation on the y-axis.

53
00:02:12,02 --> 00:02:15,07
So we can say 100 pixels on the x-axis

54
00:02:15,07 --> 00:02:21,03
and perhaps 200 pixels on the y-axis.

55
00:02:21,03 --> 00:02:25,04
So when we save that and refresh our robot once more,

56
00:02:25,04 --> 00:02:28,06
the image has moved slightly over 100 pixels to the right

57
00:02:28,06 --> 00:02:31,08
and down 200 pixels.

58
00:02:31,08 --> 00:02:34,03
Transforms can also scale and rotate objects

59
00:02:34,03 --> 00:02:36,01
in addition to translating them.

60
00:02:36,01 --> 00:02:38,07
We can also perform those on both the x and y-axis

61
00:02:38,07 --> 00:02:41,08
at the same time or separately.

62
00:02:41,08 --> 00:02:44,01
So let's add some rotation and scale to our robot

63
00:02:44,01 --> 00:02:46,07
and see what happens.

64
00:02:46,07 --> 00:02:51,03
I'll add a scale of two after our translation

65
00:02:51,03 --> 00:02:55,07
and then a rotation of 45 degrees.

66
00:02:55,07 --> 00:02:57,08
So that will make our robot double in size,

67
00:02:57,08 --> 00:03:01,04
the scale of two, and rotate it 45 degrees.

68
00:03:01,04 --> 00:03:05,03
If we save that and refresh our page once more,

69
00:03:05,03 --> 00:03:07,08
we'll see that our translation stayed in place

70
00:03:07,08 --> 00:03:13,02
and our robot is now twice its size and rotated 45 degrees.

71
00:03:13,02 --> 00:03:15,06
Notice how each time we refresh our page,

72
00:03:15,06 --> 00:03:18,03
our robot shows up in a slightly different

73
00:03:18,03 --> 00:03:20,04
position and scale and rotation,

74
00:03:20,04 --> 00:03:24,01
but we never see any movement or anything like that.

75
00:03:24,01 --> 00:03:26,09
Transforms will change how our object appears,

76
00:03:26,09 --> 00:03:29,09
but they won't create animation.

77
00:03:29,09 --> 00:03:31,05
Transforms have a stacking order,

78
00:03:31,05 --> 00:03:34,03
which means the order you apply each transformation in

79
00:03:34,03 --> 00:03:36,08
will affect the overall look.

80
00:03:36,08 --> 00:03:38,09
Each additional transformation is compounded

81
00:03:38,09 --> 00:03:41,07
on top of the ones that have come before it in the list.

82
00:03:41,07 --> 00:03:43,03
So if we go back to our CSS

83
00:03:43,03 --> 00:03:45,09
and change the order of these transformed functions,

84
00:03:45,09 --> 00:03:48,04
we'll see a slightly different result.

85
00:03:48,04 --> 00:03:51,05
So for example, I can take this rotation

86
00:03:51,05 --> 00:03:55,08
and move it to the beginning of our transform list.

87
00:03:55,08 --> 00:03:57,08
And then maybe I'll also take the scale

88
00:03:57,08 --> 00:04:02,00
and move it before the translation as well.

89
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:05,02
And now when we save that and refresh our page,

90
00:04:05,02 --> 00:04:07,04
our robot is in a slightly different position

91
00:04:07,04 --> 00:04:11,04
because our transforms were applied in a different order.

92
00:04:11,04 --> 00:04:13,08
So that goes to show that it's important to remember

93
00:04:13,08 --> 00:04:16,02
when we're using the transform property like this,

94
00:04:16,02 --> 00:04:18,02
that the order of the transform functions

95
00:04:18,02 --> 00:04:20,06
will affect the end result.

96
00:04:20,06 --> 00:04:23,03
I should note that some browsers are starting to support

97
00:04:23,03 --> 00:04:24,09
independent transform properties

98
00:04:24,09 --> 00:04:26,09
behind an experimental flag.

99
00:04:26,09 --> 00:04:28,04
But at the time of recording,

100
00:04:28,04 --> 00:04:30,02
this isn't yet widely supported

101
00:04:30,02 --> 00:04:32,06
so we'll be using the single transform property

102
00:04:32,06 --> 00:04:35,06
like we just saw in this example.

103
00:04:35,06 --> 00:04:37,04
So that's a quick look into transforms

104
00:04:37,04 --> 00:04:38,04
and how you can use them

105
00:04:38,04 --> 00:04:41,00
to change the appearance of elements on your page.
