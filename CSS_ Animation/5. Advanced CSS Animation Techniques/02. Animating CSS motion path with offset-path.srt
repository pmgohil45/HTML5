00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,08
- [Narrator] Now that we have our offset path

2
00:00:01,08 --> 00:00:04,06
assigned to our element, it's time to animate it.

3
00:00:04,06 --> 00:00:08,04
Just to recap, our robot is an image in our HTML

4
00:00:08,04 --> 00:00:11,04
and in our CSS we've assigned an offset path

5
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:13,03
to our robot image.

6
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:14,08
There are a few different properties

7
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:17,02
that work along with the offset path property,

8
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:19,07
but the two that are most useful for animation

9
00:00:19,07 --> 00:00:23,04
are the offset distance and the offset rotation.

10
00:00:23,04 --> 00:00:26,05
Offset distance represents how far along the offset path

11
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:28,03
the element in question is,

12
00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:30,08
you can use this to place a number of elements

13
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:34,01
spaced out along a particular path, or in our case,

14
00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:36,08
we'll use it to move an element along a path

15
00:00:36,08 --> 00:00:39,09
by animating it's offset distance value.

16
00:00:39,09 --> 00:00:42,04
I'll start by writing a set of key frames to animate

17
00:00:42,04 --> 00:00:44,07
that offset distance value.

18
00:00:44,07 --> 00:00:47,04
I'm going to call this set of key frames fly

19
00:00:47,04 --> 00:00:50,08
because that's kind of what the robot will be doing,

20
00:00:50,08 --> 00:00:55,06
and I'll start at the 0% key frame with an offset distance

21
00:00:55,06 --> 00:00:56,09
of 0%.

22
00:00:56,09 --> 00:01:00,04
So that is 0% of the way along the path,

23
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:03,09
effectively the start of the path.

24
00:01:03,09 --> 00:01:07,05
And I'll create a 100% key frame with an offset distance

25
00:01:07,05 --> 00:01:12,02
of 100%, which is all the way across to the end of the path.

26
00:01:12,02 --> 00:01:15,01
This will make whichever element we apply this to

27
00:01:15,01 --> 00:01:17,02
animate from the very start of the path

28
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:19,09
to the very end of the path.

29
00:01:19,09 --> 00:01:22,03
I should note that the key frame percentages

30
00:01:22,03 --> 00:01:24,03
and the offset distance percentages

31
00:01:24,03 --> 00:01:26,00
don't have to match exactly.

32
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:29,04
It's just how it worked out for this particular example.

33
00:01:29,04 --> 00:01:31,00
With those key frames in place,

34
00:01:31,00 --> 00:01:35,02
we can assign those key frames to our robot image.

35
00:01:35,02 --> 00:01:38,05
So I'll give our robot image the animation of fly.

36
00:01:38,05 --> 00:01:40,08
I'm going to give it a duration of nine seconds

37
00:01:40,08 --> 00:01:43,04
because it's got a lot of ground to cover.

38
00:01:43,04 --> 00:01:46,05
I'm going to use a custom cubic bezier for the easing

39
00:01:46,05 --> 00:01:49,01
and I'll give it an animation film mode of both,

40
00:01:49,01 --> 00:01:51,02
that way it will stay at the end of the path

41
00:01:51,02 --> 00:01:55,08
once it's animated to that offset distance of 100%.

42
00:01:55,08 --> 00:01:59,06
If we save this in preview it now,

43
00:01:59,06 --> 00:02:03,00
our robot animates along the path we set as the offset path

44
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:04,07
and that's pretty cool.

45
00:02:04,07 --> 00:02:07,02
You'll notice that our robot image is rotating

46
00:02:07,02 --> 00:02:08,07
as it goes along the path,

47
00:02:08,07 --> 00:02:11,02
and that's because the offset rotate property

48
00:02:11,02 --> 00:02:13,01
is set to auto by default.

49
00:02:13,01 --> 00:02:16,00
So we didn't set an offset rotate property,

50
00:02:16,00 --> 00:02:18,08
but right now it's as if we wrote this

51
00:02:18,08 --> 00:02:21,04
and that will make the element that's following the path

52
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:25,07
auto rotate to keep itself oriented to the path.

53
00:02:25,07 --> 00:02:28,06
If we wanted to, we can add an angle in addition

54
00:02:28,06 --> 00:02:29,06
to this auto.

55
00:02:29,06 --> 00:02:32,09
So I could add, let's say an additional 45 degrees,

56
00:02:32,09 --> 00:02:35,05
which essentially says follow the path

57
00:02:35,05 --> 00:02:38,04
with the offset rotate of auto, but lean forward

58
00:02:38,04 --> 00:02:41,05
just by 45 degrees in addition to that.

59
00:02:41,05 --> 00:02:44,01
So if we save that in preview our robot again,

60
00:02:44,01 --> 00:02:46,09
now we have the robot following along the path

61
00:02:46,09 --> 00:02:48,09
but leaning just a little bit forward

62
00:02:48,09 --> 00:02:51,00
and maybe that's a kind of fun effect,

63
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:52,07
I don't know, I think personally I prefer

64
00:02:52,07 --> 00:02:55,01
just the straight up auto value,

65
00:02:55,01 --> 00:02:57,00
but I wanted to show you that there were some options

66
00:02:57,00 --> 00:02:58,02
there as well.

67
00:02:58,02 --> 00:03:01,04
So I'll go back to auto and preview our robot once more,

68
00:03:01,04 --> 00:03:07,01
and our robot animates along the path in that loop shape.

69
00:03:07,01 --> 00:03:10,05
As I mentioned, offset path is still a fairly new property

70
00:03:10,05 --> 00:03:12,09
and it will most definitely be evolving.

71
00:03:12,09 --> 00:03:15,01
It can also be a bit tricky when you have to use

72
00:03:15,01 --> 00:03:17,02
the SVG path syntax.

73
00:03:17,02 --> 00:03:19,06
Animating with offset path is definitely something

74
00:03:19,06 --> 00:03:22,05
worth knowing about and trying out for yourself,

75
00:03:22,05 --> 00:03:23,08
but at the time of recording,

76
00:03:23,08 --> 00:03:26,08
it's not something I'd recommend using in production,

77
00:03:26,08 --> 00:03:30,00
at least not until it's more widely supported by browsers.
