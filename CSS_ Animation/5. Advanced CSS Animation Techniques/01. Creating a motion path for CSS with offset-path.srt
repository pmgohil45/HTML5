00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,04
- [Instructor] Motion Paths are fairly new to CSS right now,

2
00:00:03,04 --> 00:00:05,01
but as support for them increases,

3
00:00:05,01 --> 00:00:08,07
you'll be able to use them more and more in your own work.

4
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:12,09
CSS Motion Paths are created using the offset-path property.

5
00:00:12,09 --> 00:00:14,05
This might sound a bit weird at first,

6
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:16,00
but the reason for this is

7
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:17,07
that you can use the offset-path

8
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:19,04
to do more than just motion.

9
00:00:19,04 --> 00:00:22,07
So it makes a little more sense in that context.

10
00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:24,00
To create an offset-path,

11
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,09
the first thing you need is, well, a path.

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:30,02
At the moment, paths defined with SVG path syntax

13
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:32,00
are the most widely supported,

14
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:34,04
but there are other options that may gain greater support

15
00:00:34,04 --> 00:00:35,06
in the near future.

16
00:00:35,06 --> 00:00:40,01
For now, we'll use the SVG path syntax option.

17
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:42,03
You can get this SVG path definition

18
00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:46,01
from anywhere you typically draw or code SVGs.

19
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:49,06
I drew this path here in XD and I'm going to use that

20
00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:52,04
for the source of my SVG path code.

21
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:56,03
So for this one, I will right-click and say Copy SVG Code,

22
00:00:56,03 --> 00:00:57,08
got that on my clipboard,

23
00:00:57,08 --> 00:00:59,01
and then I'll move to my Code Editor

24
00:00:59,01 --> 00:01:01,05
just to paste this into a blank document

25
00:01:01,05 --> 00:01:05,06
so you can see what kind of code we're working with.

26
00:01:05,06 --> 00:01:08,05
In this case, I've copied the code for the entire SVG,

27
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:11,01
which normally would be exactly what I want,

28
00:01:11,01 --> 00:01:14,02
but in this case, I only want that path shape,

29
00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:16,06
so the only part of this SVG I need

30
00:01:16,06 --> 00:01:19,02
is this part right here in the D equals.

31
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:23,04
From this capital N all the way down to the 219.99.

32
00:01:23,04 --> 00:01:24,06
Everything within these quotes,

33
00:01:24,06 --> 00:01:27,08
that's what we'll need for our path definition.

34
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:30,01
One thing to note if you're getting your path definition

35
00:01:30,01 --> 00:01:32,01
from a visual drawing tool,

36
00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:35,01
these tools often add a transform onto your path,

37
00:01:35,01 --> 00:01:38,05
so for example, I have a transform right here.

38
00:01:38,05 --> 00:01:41,08
If you see very large numbers in this transform property,

39
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:43,08
there's a good chance your path will show up

40
00:01:43,08 --> 00:01:46,02
in a completely different place than you intend it to,

41
00:01:46,02 --> 00:01:48,04
so keep an eye out for that.

42
00:01:48,04 --> 00:01:50,06
So I'm going to grab this path definition.

43
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:53,04
I'm going to copy it and head over to my CSS

44
00:01:53,04 --> 00:01:55,09
to put this into an offset-path.

45
00:01:55,09 --> 00:01:57,06
I'm going to use this path definition

46
00:01:57,06 --> 00:01:59,06
to make one of our robots do a loop-de-loop

47
00:01:59,06 --> 00:02:01,01
across the screen.

48
00:02:01,01 --> 00:02:03,06
That robot is an image with a class of bot,

49
00:02:03,06 --> 00:02:07,05
so I'm going to assign it an offset-path property.

50
00:02:07,05 --> 00:02:08,06
And in that offset-path,

51
00:02:08,06 --> 00:02:10,05
I'm going to use the path definition

52
00:02:10,05 --> 00:02:12,05
I just copied from my SVG.

53
00:02:12,05 --> 00:02:14,08
So I'll give that the offset-path of path

54
00:02:14,08 --> 00:02:19,03
and then paste in the path information I copied from my SVG,

55
00:02:19,03 --> 00:02:21,05
finish off that line

56
00:02:21,05 --> 00:02:24,03
and I'll save my CSS.

57
00:02:24,03 --> 00:02:26,07
If I preview my file and my browser right now,

58
00:02:26,07 --> 00:02:28,04
I don't really see anything at all.

59
00:02:28,04 --> 00:02:31,04
I have my robot image and it has a path applied,

60
00:02:31,04 --> 00:02:34,03
but I haven't told it what to do with that offset-path,

61
00:02:34,03 --> 00:02:36,00
and we'll look at how to do that next.
