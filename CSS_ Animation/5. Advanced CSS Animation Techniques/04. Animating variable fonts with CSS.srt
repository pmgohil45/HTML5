00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,02
- [Instructor] Variable fonts are a game changer

2
00:00:02,02 --> 00:00:03,08
for web typography.

3
00:00:03,08 --> 00:00:06,06
A variable font is a font file that is able to store

4
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:09,00
a continuous range of design variants

5
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:12,06
and we can animate those variants with CSS.

6
00:00:12,06 --> 00:00:14,07
The key to animating variable fonts

7
00:00:14,07 --> 00:00:17,02
is the font-variation-settings property.

8
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:19,03
We can animate any access of variation

9
00:00:19,03 --> 00:00:21,00
defined in the font itself

10
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:24,03
with the font-variation-settings property.

11
00:00:24,03 --> 00:00:25,09
The variants available to animate

12
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:27,09
will vary from font to font

13
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:30,06
and a site like wakamaifondue.com

14
00:00:30,06 --> 00:00:32,05
can help show you the options that are available

15
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:34,05
for any given variable font.

16
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:36,00
For example, if I drop a copy

17
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:38,06
of the Recursive variable font on the site,

18
00:00:38,06 --> 00:00:41,03
it will give me this report of all the characteristics

19
00:00:41,03 --> 00:00:44,06
and variable axes available in this particular font.

20
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:46,04
I can even test them out right here

21
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:49,09
to see what they look like.

22
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:52,00
Many fonts will show their variable properties

23
00:00:52,00 --> 00:00:56,03
on their websites as well like Recursive does here.

24
00:00:56,03 --> 00:00:58,01
Looking at the demo section of the page,

25
00:00:58,01 --> 00:01:01,02
we can see that Recursive has five axes of variation,

26
00:01:01,02 --> 00:01:05,00
mono, casual, weight, slant, and cursive.

27
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:07,08
Each axis has its own four-letter name

28
00:01:07,08 --> 00:01:09,09
and each of these can take a range of values

29
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:13,06
as shown in the demo.

30
00:01:13,06 --> 00:01:14,09
As those values change,

31
00:01:14,09 --> 00:01:17,02
the appearance of the font changes

32
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:19,03
and the font-variation-settings property

33
00:01:19,03 --> 00:01:22,03
lets us animate those value changes.

34
00:01:22,03 --> 00:01:26,04
Let's go look at some of this in action in our own CSS.

35
00:01:26,04 --> 00:01:29,00
I'm using the same font we just looked at, Recursive,

36
00:01:29,00 --> 00:01:31,07
here in my example.

37
00:01:31,07 --> 00:01:34,03
Let's animate some of the variable aspects of Recursive

38
00:01:34,03 --> 00:01:36,08
with a key frame animation.

39
00:01:36,08 --> 00:01:40,02
So I'll write my key frame block

40
00:01:40,02 --> 00:01:42,02
and I'll name this animation VARS

41
00:01:42,02 --> 00:01:45,03
since we're animating a variable font.

42
00:01:45,03 --> 00:01:47,04
I'll start with my 0% key frame

43
00:01:47,04 --> 00:01:49,00
and this is where I can start to use

44
00:01:49,00 --> 00:01:51,07
the font-variation-settings property.

45
00:01:51,07 --> 00:01:54,08
We know from its site that Recursive has axes

46
00:01:54,08 --> 00:01:58,07
for casual, cursive, weight, and slant.

47
00:01:58,07 --> 00:02:00,07
I'll use these in the font-variation-settings

48
00:02:00,07 --> 00:02:02,06
to create my animation.

49
00:02:02,06 --> 00:02:06,08
So we'll start with the font-variation-settings property.

50
00:02:06,08 --> 00:02:08,01
And first, I'll use the name

51
00:02:08,01 --> 00:02:12,02
of the casual axis which is CASL

52
00:02:12,02 --> 00:02:15,02
and start with a value of one.

53
00:02:15,02 --> 00:02:20,03
Then onto the cursive axis which is CRSV.

54
00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:24,00
Give that a value of one as well.

55
00:02:24,00 --> 00:02:29,04
And for weight which is WGHT,

56
00:02:29,04 --> 00:02:32,03
we'll go with 300.

57
00:02:32,03 --> 00:02:35,06
And slant which is SLNT.

58
00:02:35,06 --> 00:02:38,08
We'll give that a value of zero.

59
00:02:38,08 --> 00:02:39,07
I'm going to go on

60
00:02:39,07 --> 00:02:44,00
and add a couple more key frames for 25% and 75%

61
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:46,04
with different settings in the font-variation-settings

62
00:02:46,04 --> 00:02:51,06
just for a little variation in our animation.

63
00:02:51,06 --> 00:02:58,00
At 25, I'll set the casual axis to zero.

64
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:01,04
Cursive also to zero.

65
00:03:01,04 --> 00:03:08,00
Weight to 600 to get a little bit heftier in the weight

66
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:14,03
and the slant to minus 10.

67
00:03:14,03 --> 00:03:18,08
At 75%, I'll set the casual back to zero.

68
00:03:18,08 --> 00:03:23,06
The cursive remaining at zero.

69
00:03:23,06 --> 00:03:27,04
The weight at 300

70
00:03:27,04 --> 00:03:32,06
and our slant at minus 10.

71
00:03:32,06 --> 00:03:33,07
And since I'm going to have

72
00:03:33,07 --> 00:03:36,01
this animation repeating infinitely,

73
00:03:36,01 --> 00:03:40,00
I will make our 100% key frame equal to our 0% key frame

74
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:44,00
so that way it'll start and end in exactly the same place.

75
00:03:44,00 --> 00:03:45,00
Last but not least,

76
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:48,03
I'll assign this animation to our h1.

77
00:03:48,03 --> 00:03:50,09
So we'll give it animation of VARS

78
00:03:50,09 --> 00:03:52,07
and I'll have it take eight seconds.

79
00:03:52,07 --> 00:03:54,01
Make it a little bit long.

80
00:03:54,01 --> 00:03:56,00
Have it repeat infinitely

81
00:03:56,00 --> 00:03:58,03
and I'm going to use the easing of linear

82
00:03:58,03 --> 00:04:00,03
just so we can really get a sense

83
00:04:00,03 --> 00:04:03,07
of how the variable font itself is changing

84
00:04:03,07 --> 00:04:06,00
and animating as it goes.

85
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:07,02
So we can save this

86
00:04:07,02 --> 00:04:12,08
and preview it in our browser, refresh.

87
00:04:12,08 --> 00:04:15,07
And you can see we have our h1 that has the word hello in it

88
00:04:15,07 --> 00:04:18,06
animating through the variations of the axis we adjusted

89
00:04:18,06 --> 00:04:21,01
through our key frame animation.

90
00:04:21,01 --> 00:04:23,00
There's so much potential in what we can do

91
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:24,09
with animating variable fonts

92
00:04:24,09 --> 00:04:27,01
and they allow us to create animation effects

93
00:04:27,01 --> 00:04:29,05
that wouldn't be possible without them.

94
00:04:29,05 --> 00:04:31,08
But I should note that at the time of recording,

95
00:04:31,08 --> 00:04:33,09
variable fonts are still fairly new,

96
00:04:33,09 --> 00:04:35,07
so there are a couple of things to keep in mind

97
00:04:35,07 --> 00:04:38,01
if you're using them for animation.

98
00:04:38,01 --> 00:04:41,09
First is that not all variable fonts are created equal.

99
00:04:41,09 --> 00:04:44,00
Some may have very interesting axes

100
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:46,02
for you to animate for creative effects

101
00:04:46,02 --> 00:04:48,08
while others may have a very limited range.

102
00:04:48,08 --> 00:04:50,02
It might take a bit of time

103
00:04:50,02 --> 00:04:52,07
to find the ones that have the range you like.

104
00:04:52,07 --> 00:04:55,03
The second is that animating variable fonts

105
00:04:55,03 --> 00:04:57,04
is currently not very performant,

106
00:04:57,04 --> 00:05:00,00
so it's best to use it sparingly in production.

107
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:02,08
This might change as variable fonts see more use,

108
00:05:02,08 --> 00:05:05,00
but keep an eye on your animation performance

109
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:08,08
if you're using variable font animations in your projects.

110
00:05:08,08 --> 00:05:10,05
Variable fonts are very interesting

111
00:05:10,05 --> 00:05:13,00
to experiment with for many reasons,

112
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:14,08
so I highly recommend checking them out

113
00:05:14,08 --> 00:05:18,00
and taking a look at the power they bring to the web.
