1
00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,00
- [Instructor] CSS custom properties,

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:04,02
otherwise known as CSS variables,

3
00:00:04,02 --> 00:00:05,09
make it possible to create key frames

4
00:00:05,09 --> 00:00:08,03
that are more dynamic and flexible.

5
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:10,02
In the earlier days of web animation,

6
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,08
one drawback of CSS key frame animation

7
00:00:12,08 --> 00:00:14,04
was the fact that you couldn't change

8
00:00:14,04 --> 00:00:17,00
or alter the key frames once they were written.

9
00:00:17,00 --> 00:00:20,03
CSS variables change all of that.

10
00:00:20,03 --> 00:00:21,01
In short,

11
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:24,00
CSS variables allow you to define and reuse

12
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:27,03
your own custom values within your CSS.

13
00:00:27,03 --> 00:00:28,06
There are a number of things

14
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:30,06
that make CSS variables different than,

15
00:00:30,06 --> 00:00:33,06
say, preprocessor variables that you might've used before.

16
00:00:33,06 --> 00:00:35,08
But three things that really stand out

17
00:00:35,08 --> 00:00:38,05
are the fact that they can be changed at runtime,

18
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:40,08
they follow the CSS cascade,

19
00:00:40,08 --> 00:00:44,05
and they can be easily accessed by JavaScript.

20
00:00:44,05 --> 00:00:46,01
When it comes to animation,

21
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:47,07
we can use CSS variables

22
00:00:47,07 --> 00:00:49,09
both in our key frame definitions

23
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:52,04
and when we're assigning animation properties

24
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:53,07
to individual elements.

25
00:00:53,07 --> 00:00:57,02
So there's a lot of potential for flexibility.

26
00:00:57,02 --> 00:00:59,02
Let's take a look at all of this in action

27
00:00:59,02 --> 00:01:00,07
and use one set of key frames

28
00:01:00,07 --> 00:01:05,00
and create four words that animate in in different ways.

29
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:06,02
To start out our example,

30
00:01:06,02 --> 00:01:07,04
I have a set of key frames

31
00:01:07,04 --> 00:01:10,00
that transforms elements along the X axis

32
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:12,00
from somewhere far off to the left

33
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:14,03
with a scale of one and no rotation

34
00:01:14,03 --> 00:01:17,02
to a place exactly where they would normally be

35
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:21,06
with a scale of 1.5 and a rotation of 10 degrees.

36
00:01:21,06 --> 00:01:24,04
I've applied this animation to all of my paragraphs

37
00:01:24,04 --> 00:01:27,07
with the same duration and the same easing.

38
00:01:27,07 --> 00:01:30,02
That means when I go to preview our files so far,

39
00:01:30,02 --> 00:01:31,05
we'll see this,

40
00:01:31,05 --> 00:01:33,04
all four of my paragraphs animate in

41
00:01:33,04 --> 00:01:35,00
with the exact same animation

42
00:01:35,00 --> 00:01:38,02
and start and end in the exact same place.

43
00:01:38,02 --> 00:01:41,02
Now if I wanted all four of these words to animate in

44
00:01:41,02 --> 00:01:42,05
in slightly different ways,

45
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:44,07
I could write four different animations,

46
00:01:44,07 --> 00:01:46,00
one for each word,

47
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:48,05
or I could use CSS variables

48
00:01:48,05 --> 00:01:50,03
to make my key frames more dynamic

49
00:01:50,03 --> 00:01:54,04
and adjust the animation slightly for each different word.

50
00:01:54,04 --> 00:01:58,03
And that's the route I'm going to take for this example.

51
00:01:58,03 --> 00:02:00,00
So I'll head back to my CSS

52
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,07
and start adding some CSS variables to use.

53
00:02:03,07 --> 00:02:06,01
I'm going to start by declaring some CSS variables

54
00:02:06,01 --> 00:02:08,00
at the root of my document.

55
00:02:08,00 --> 00:02:12,06
And since my animation is moving things a certain distance

56
00:02:12,06 --> 00:02:14,07
scaling to a certain scale amount

57
00:02:14,07 --> 00:02:17,02
and rotating to a certain number of degrees,

58
00:02:17,02 --> 00:02:21,01
those are the three things I'll make variables for first.

59
00:02:21,01 --> 00:02:24,06
So I'll make a CSS variable of distance or dist rather,

60
00:02:24,06 --> 00:02:31,02
and I will set its default at 0%.

61
00:02:31,02 --> 00:02:34,01
I'll create a CSS variable of scale,

62
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:37,05
and I'll set its default at two.

63
00:02:37,05 --> 00:02:39,07
I'll create a CSS variable degrees

64
00:02:39,07 --> 00:02:42,03
or deg, I guess, is how you might say that,

65
00:02:42,03 --> 00:02:46,07
and I will set that default to 10 degrees.

66
00:02:46,07 --> 00:02:47,08
With those all set,

67
00:02:47,08 --> 00:02:50,05
I'll go and reference them in my key frames.

68
00:02:50,05 --> 00:02:52,07
So at my 100% key frame,

69
00:02:52,07 --> 00:02:55,01
instead of translating to 0%,

70
00:02:55,01 --> 00:02:59,06
I'll translate to the variable of distance or dist,

71
00:02:59,06 --> 00:03:02,01
as I wrote above,

72
00:03:02,01 --> 00:03:06,01
And instead of scaling to the hard-coded number of 1.5,

73
00:03:06,01 --> 00:03:09,09
I'll scale to my variable of scale.

74
00:03:09,09 --> 00:03:14,01
And the same for rotation.

75
00:03:14,01 --> 00:03:15,09
And now that I have those variable set

76
00:03:15,09 --> 00:03:17,08
for my 100% key frame,

77
00:03:17,08 --> 00:03:19,05
I can adjust those variables

78
00:03:19,05 --> 00:03:24,02
for each individual paragraph thanks to the CSS cascade.

79
00:03:24,02 --> 00:03:25,08
I'll start with my first paragraph

80
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:28,08
and adjust some or all of these variable values

81
00:03:28,08 --> 00:03:30,01
for each of my paragraphs

82
00:03:30,01 --> 00:03:33,03
so that the visual results of the 100% key frame

83
00:03:33,03 --> 00:03:36,09
will be slightly different for each.

84
00:03:36,09 --> 00:03:38,06
So starting with my first paragraph,

85
00:03:38,06 --> 00:03:43,05
I'll give it the scale variable value of 1.75.

86
00:03:43,05 --> 00:03:48,04
I'll give it the dist variable value of 80%

87
00:03:48,04 --> 00:03:53,02
and the degree of variable value of five degrees.

88
00:03:53,02 --> 00:03:55,01
So changing all of the values,

89
00:03:55,01 --> 00:03:56,00
at least slightly,

90
00:03:56,00 --> 00:03:58,08
for our first paragraph.

91
00:03:58,08 --> 00:04:00,01
For our second paragraph,

92
00:04:00,01 --> 00:04:02,02
I'm not going to change all of the values for this one.

93
00:04:02,02 --> 00:04:04,04
I'll let one of them use the default value

94
00:04:04,04 --> 00:04:05,07
set up at the root.

95
00:04:05,07 --> 00:04:11,05
So I will give it the scale variable value of 1.5.

96
00:04:11,05 --> 00:04:17,01
And I will give it the dist variable value of 30%.

97
00:04:17,01 --> 00:04:21,01
I haven't given my second paragraph a degree variable value.

98
00:04:21,01 --> 00:04:23,02
So that means it will default to use the one

99
00:04:23,02 --> 00:04:24,07
that set up here in my root,

100
00:04:24,07 --> 00:04:29,07
which will be the degree rotation of 10 degrees.

101
00:04:29,07 --> 00:04:30,08
I'm sure you're starting to see

102
00:04:30,08 --> 00:04:33,09
the power of CSS variables here.

103
00:04:33,09 --> 00:04:35,02
For my third paragraph,

104
00:04:35,02 --> 00:04:36,09
I'm going to let it use

105
00:04:36,09 --> 00:04:39,02
the root value of the scale variable,

106
00:04:39,02 --> 00:04:42,03
but I'll give it a degree variable of minus five degrees,

107
00:04:42,03 --> 00:04:43,09
so the rotation will be slightly different

108
00:04:43,09 --> 00:04:45,05
than the ones above.

109
00:04:45,05 --> 00:04:51,01
And then I'll give it the distance variable of 100%.

110
00:04:51,01 --> 00:04:52,02
Last but not least,

111
00:04:52,02 --> 00:04:54,00
I will give my fourth paragraph

112
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:00,03
the scale variable value of 1.9,

113
00:05:00,03 --> 00:05:05,02
the deg or degree variable value of 15 degrees.

114
00:05:05,02 --> 00:05:07,00
And I think I'll leave it at that.

115
00:05:07,00 --> 00:05:08,09
So if I save our file now

116
00:05:08,09 --> 00:05:13,03
and preview what we've got,

117
00:05:13,03 --> 00:05:15,08
all four words are still animating in

118
00:05:15,08 --> 00:05:18,02
with the same duration, the same easing,

119
00:05:18,02 --> 00:05:19,09
but their ending point is visually different,

120
00:05:19,09 --> 00:05:22,04
because we've used those CSS variables

121
00:05:22,04 --> 00:05:25,00
to change the 100% key frame values

122
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:28,06
for each of those paragraphs.

123
00:05:28,06 --> 00:05:30,02
That's already pretty great,

124
00:05:30,02 --> 00:05:32,09
but we can make our animations even more dynamic

125
00:05:32,09 --> 00:05:35,07
if we use variables in our animation assignment

126
00:05:35,07 --> 00:05:37,06
as well as in the key frames.

127
00:05:37,06 --> 00:05:42,01
So let's go back to our CSS and do a little of that.

128
00:05:42,01 --> 00:05:44,05
I'm going to go back to where I define my variables

129
00:05:44,05 --> 00:05:46,09
at the root.

130
00:05:46,09 --> 00:05:49,01
And I'm going to add three variables

131
00:05:49,01 --> 00:05:53,03
we can use for our animation assignment.

132
00:05:53,03 --> 00:05:56,02
Specifically, that will be a dur or duration variable.

133
00:05:56,02 --> 00:05:58,00
And I'll set that by default at two seconds,

134
00:05:58,00 --> 00:05:59,06
since that's already what we have

135
00:05:59,06 --> 00:06:04,06
in our animation assignment.

136
00:06:04,06 --> 00:06:06,07
I'll create a delay variable,

137
00:06:06,07 --> 00:06:11,09
and I will set that default value to zero seconds.

138
00:06:11,09 --> 00:06:13,08
And I'll create an ease variable

139
00:06:13,08 --> 00:06:17,04
and give it the default value of linear.

140
00:06:17,04 --> 00:06:20,04
Next, I'll use those variables in our animation assignment

141
00:06:20,04 --> 00:06:22,07
that we've assigned to all of our paragraphs.

142
00:06:22,07 --> 00:06:23,06
So for example,

143
00:06:23,06 --> 00:06:26,04
here I have the duration of two seconds in the shorthand,

144
00:06:26,04 --> 00:06:27,08
and I can replace that

145
00:06:27,08 --> 00:06:32,00
with the variable of dur or duration.

146
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:33,08
I don't have a delay set on this currently,

147
00:06:33,08 --> 00:06:37,02
but I could add a variable for delay here.

148
00:06:37,02 --> 00:06:40,02
The second number with time in the animation shorthand

149
00:06:40,02 --> 00:06:41,05
will be the delay,

150
00:06:41,05 --> 00:06:45,04
and that counts the same when we're using variables as well.

151
00:06:45,04 --> 00:06:46,04
And last but not least,

152
00:06:46,04 --> 00:06:52,05
I will replace our linear easing with our easing variable.

153
00:06:52,05 --> 00:06:54,08
So that means that the variable values

154
00:06:54,08 --> 00:06:57,07
will be used in place of the hard-coded numbers and easing

155
00:06:57,07 --> 00:06:59,09
I had here before.

156
00:06:59,09 --> 00:07:02,08
Just like we did with our 100% key frame variables,

157
00:07:02,08 --> 00:07:05,01
we can adjust the value of these variables

158
00:07:05,01 --> 00:07:07,03
for each of our individual paragraphs,

159
00:07:07,03 --> 00:07:09,07
and that will give us even more of a dynamic look

160
00:07:09,07 --> 00:07:13,03
to our animations.

161
00:07:13,03 --> 00:07:16,01
So for paragraph one,

162
00:07:16,01 --> 00:07:18,03
I'm going to give it a different duration of,

163
00:07:18,03 --> 00:07:20,05
say, 1.9 seconds.

164
00:07:20,05 --> 00:07:23,01
It'll be a little bit faster than the rest.

165
00:07:23,01 --> 00:07:26,02
And I will give it a custom easing with the ease variable,

166
00:07:26,02 --> 00:07:37,07
and that will be a cubic Bezier.

167
00:07:37,07 --> 00:07:38,09
For paragraph two,

168
00:07:38,09 --> 00:07:43,02
I'll give it a delay variable value of maybe 0.5 seconds,

169
00:07:43,02 --> 00:07:45,02
just a little bit of a delay.

170
00:07:45,02 --> 00:07:48,03
And I'm going to give it an easing variable value

171
00:07:48,03 --> 00:07:55,05
of its own cubic Bezier as well.

172
00:07:55,05 --> 00:07:56,09
For paragraph three,

173
00:07:56,09 --> 00:07:58,09
let's just give it a different easing value.

174
00:07:58,09 --> 00:08:00,07
So we'll use the ease variable

175
00:08:00,07 --> 00:08:06,04
and give it a cubic Bezier value as well.

176
00:08:06,04 --> 00:08:12,07
And I'll do the same for our fourth paragraph as well.

177
00:08:12,07 --> 00:08:14,05
With those additions in place,

178
00:08:14,05 --> 00:08:21,08
we can save and preview our file once again.

179
00:08:21,08 --> 00:08:22,07
And as you can see,

180
00:08:22,07 --> 00:08:24,00
with those additional variables,

181
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:25,08
we've made the animation even more different

182
00:08:25,08 --> 00:08:27,05
for each individual word.

183
00:08:27,05 --> 00:08:29,09
They're all still using the same set of key frames

184
00:08:29,09 --> 00:08:31,08
and the same animation assignment.

185
00:08:31,08 --> 00:08:33,06
But thanks to our CSS variables,

186
00:08:33,06 --> 00:08:36,07
they've all got a slightly different look.

187
00:08:36,07 --> 00:08:37,08
And this is just the start

188
00:08:37,08 --> 00:08:40,01
of how we can make our CSS animations

189
00:08:40,01 --> 00:08:42,05
even more dynamic with CSS variables.

190
00:08:42,05 --> 00:08:45,02
We could take this even further by using JavaScript

191
00:08:45,02 --> 00:08:47,08
to change the values of these variables at runtime,

192
00:08:47,08 --> 00:08:49,00
and even more.

193
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:51,04
So CSS variables are really wonderful

194
00:08:51,04 --> 00:08:54,07
when they're paired with CSS animation.

195
00:08:54,07 --> 00:08:56,06
If you found this example interesting,

196
00:08:56,06 --> 00:08:59,06
I highly recommend learning more about CSS variables

197
00:08:59,06 --> 00:09:02,00
and the powerful things they can do.
