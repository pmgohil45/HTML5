00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,05
(bright music)

2
00:00:06,05 --> 00:00:09,04
- [Instructor] Here's my solution to this challenge.

3
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:10,06
After the letters go up and down,

4
00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:12,03
I added a little kick on the R

5
00:00:12,03 --> 00:00:14,03
for a third animation in the chain.

6
00:00:14,03 --> 00:00:16,02
I thought that would give it a little bit of,

7
00:00:16,02 --> 00:00:18,00
I don't know, fun.

8
00:00:18,00 --> 00:00:19,01
And here's what I did to add

9
00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:21,02
that third animation to the chain.

10
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:24,06
First, I added one new set of keyframes in our CSS.

11
00:00:24,06 --> 00:00:25,04
I called it flick

12
00:00:25,04 --> 00:00:27,03
'cause that's kind of what the R is doing,

13
00:00:27,03 --> 00:00:30,02
and I used a couple of tricks in this keyframe block.

14
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:32,04
First, since I knew I wanted the R

15
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:34,05
to start and end in the same place,

16
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:37,07
I comma separated the zero and 100% keyframes

17
00:00:37,07 --> 00:00:40,06
to assign their styles at the same time.

18
00:00:40,06 --> 00:00:43,07
You can use this anytime you're reusing properties

19
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:46,05
in two sets of keyframes.

20
00:00:46,05 --> 00:00:48,04
The other thing I did was I chose

21
00:00:48,04 --> 00:00:50,00
to set the animation timing function

22
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:52,01
in the keyframe definitions themselves

23
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:53,07
so that I could use a different easing

24
00:00:53,07 --> 00:00:55,08
on the way out and the way in essentially

25
00:00:55,08 --> 00:00:57,04
of that flick movement,

26
00:00:57,04 --> 00:00:58,08
and this is something you can do

27
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:01,03
instead of adding just one animation timing function

28
00:01:01,03 --> 00:01:05,03
across the entire animation, if you want to.

29
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:07,08
Once I had this third set of keyframes in place,

30
00:01:07,08 --> 00:01:10,04
I went and assigned it to only the last letter,

31
00:01:10,04 --> 00:01:14,03
which happens to be our nth-child seven.

32
00:01:14,03 --> 00:01:16,07
Previously, we were having the flip up

33
00:01:16,07 --> 00:01:18,09
and flip down animation assignments cascading

34
00:01:18,09 --> 00:01:21,08
to all the spans and just setting the animation delay,

35
00:01:21,08 --> 00:01:24,07
but since I wanted to add a third animation in the chain

36
00:01:24,07 --> 00:01:26,02
just to this one letter,

37
00:01:26,02 --> 00:01:27,08
I rewrote those animations,

38
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:30,00
comma separated them as we did before,

39
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:32,01
so that I could add the third one to the chain

40
00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:35,03
just for this particular letter.

41
00:01:35,03 --> 00:01:36,09
I assigned the animation of flicks

42
00:01:36,09 --> 00:01:38,09
since that's what I named my keyframes.

43
00:01:38,09 --> 00:01:41,08
I gave it a duration of .95 seconds,

44
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:44,04
and I delayed it by 4.95 seconds.

45
00:01:44,04 --> 00:01:45,08
So again, a little bit longer

46
00:01:45,08 --> 00:01:47,06
than the duration of the one before it,

47
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:50,01
so there is a bit of a break in between.

48
00:01:50,01 --> 00:01:52,08
I assigned it the animation timing function of linear

49
00:01:52,08 --> 00:01:55,03
since I specified animation timing functions

50
00:01:55,03 --> 00:01:56,07
in the keyframes themselves,

51
00:01:56,07 --> 00:01:58,08
linear is the best choice here,

52
00:01:58,08 --> 00:02:01,05
and I gave it the animation film mode of forwards

53
00:02:01,05 --> 00:02:03,01
so it would hold its end position

54
00:02:03,01 --> 00:02:06,01
past the end of the animation.

55
00:02:06,01 --> 00:02:07,06
So that was my solution.

56
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:08,09
Again, this is a challenge

57
00:02:08,09 --> 00:02:10,07
where there's no right or wrong answer.

58
00:02:10,07 --> 00:02:13,02
Whatever you did to add a third animation to the chain

59
00:02:13,02 --> 00:02:16,00
was great practice in making CSS animations.
