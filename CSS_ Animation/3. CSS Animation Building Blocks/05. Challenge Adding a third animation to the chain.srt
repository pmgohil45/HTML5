1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,05
(upbeat music begins)

2
00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:06,06
- [Narrator] We've been working on chaining

3
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:08,08
multiple CSS key frame animations together

4
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:10,05
to create longer effects.

5
00:00:10,05 --> 00:00:12,01
And for this challenge,

6
00:00:12,01 --> 00:00:16,01
I'd like you to add one additional animation to the chain.

7
00:00:16,01 --> 00:00:18,04
You can use the files you've been working on already,

8
00:00:18,04 --> 00:00:22,05
or the exercise files I've provided for this challenge.

9
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:23,09
This is a nice short challenge.

10
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:26,00
You should spend maybe five or 10 minutes

11
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:27,04
creating a new set of key frames,

12
00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:29,09
and then adding it to the chain of animations.

13
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:33,00
Then watch the solution video to see what I made.
