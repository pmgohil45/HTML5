00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,06
- [Instructor] Let's look at how we can use 3D Transforms

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:05,04
in our CSS key frame animations.

3
00:00:05,04 --> 00:00:08,07
We'll create a short text effect like the one you see here.

4
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:11,02
By animating 3D Transforms on each letter

5
00:00:11,02 --> 00:00:13,07
and using animation delay to create an offset

6
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:17,07
to have that wave like motion across our full text.

7
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:20,05
We'll be rotating each letter around the X axis,

8
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:22,03
which is the axis that runs horizontal

9
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:24,08
across the browser window.

10
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,00
In our HTML,

11
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:27,09
we have each letter wrapped in its own span

12
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:30,03
so we can target them individually.

13
00:00:30,03 --> 00:00:33,04
There are helpful JavaScript libraries like Splitting JS

14
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:36,00
and others that will do this wrapping of each letter

15
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:38,08
in a span automatically for you at runtime.

16
00:00:38,08 --> 00:00:40,07
But for the purposes of this example,

17
00:00:40,07 --> 00:00:43,07
adding them manually works just fine.

18
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:47,06
So let's move to our CSS to start creating our animation.

19
00:00:47,06 --> 00:00:50,04
Since I already know I'll be using 3D Transforms.

20
00:00:50,04 --> 00:00:52,05
I'm going to start by setting two properties

21
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:55,09
on the parent H2 element to ensure that all of our letters

22
00:00:55,09 --> 00:00:58,03
will have the same perspective and vanishing point

23
00:00:58,03 --> 00:01:02,05
to make 3D effect look a little more convincing.

24
00:01:02,05 --> 00:01:06,05
So the first property I'll add is perspective.

25
00:01:06,05 --> 00:01:09,04
And the value I usually start with for this is 1000.

26
00:01:09,04 --> 00:01:12,03
And perspective is essentially the distance away

27
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:15,08
that we are from the effect.

28
00:01:15,08 --> 00:01:19,03
And I'm also going to add the transform style

29
00:01:19,03 --> 00:01:22,09
of preserved 3D.

30
00:01:22,09 --> 00:01:26,01
Next up, I'll start the key frames for this animation.

31
00:01:26,01 --> 00:01:29,06
So I'm going to call this animation, flip up

32
00:01:29,06 --> 00:01:32,09
because that's essentially what our letters will be doing.

33
00:01:32,09 --> 00:01:36,00
And I know that I want to have the letters all start folded

34
00:01:36,00 --> 00:01:38,04
back in space as if they're laying flat on the ground.

35
00:01:38,04 --> 00:01:40,01
You know, like if there was a ground.

36
00:01:40,01 --> 00:01:42,02
And then we'll have them rotate up

37
00:01:42,02 --> 00:01:45,04
to the normal standing position.

38
00:01:45,04 --> 00:01:48,05
To achieve this, I'll start with a rotation on the X axis

39
00:01:48,05 --> 00:01:50,02
of 90 degrees.

40
00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:51,08
And just to mix things up a little bit,

41
00:01:51,08 --> 00:01:55,01
I'm going to use the from and two key words to define

42
00:01:55,01 --> 00:01:57,08
our key frames instead of the percentages.

43
00:01:57,08 --> 00:02:04,06
But are from keyword is the same as a 0% key frame.

44
00:02:04,06 --> 00:02:09,02
So we'll add a rotation on the X axis of 90 degrees.

45
00:02:09,02 --> 00:02:10,08
And then for our two key frame,

46
00:02:10,08 --> 00:02:15,03
which is the same as a 100% key frame.

47
00:02:15,03 --> 00:02:18,08
We'll add a rotation of zero degrees.

48
00:02:18,08 --> 00:02:20,03
Our key frames are all set.

49
00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:22,07
So let's apply this animation to our letters.

50
00:02:22,07 --> 00:02:25,03
Now we know that all of our letters are wrapped in a span,

51
00:02:25,03 --> 00:02:28,02
so we can apply the animation to all of them here.

52
00:02:28,02 --> 00:02:30,00
We can say animation

53
00:02:30,00 --> 00:02:32,04
and we're going to assign the animation of flip-up.

54
00:02:32,04 --> 00:02:35,04
Since those are the key frames we just defined,

55
00:02:35,04 --> 00:02:38,02
I'm going to give it a duration of one second.

56
00:02:38,02 --> 00:02:40,02
And then I'm going to give it the timing function

57
00:02:40,02 --> 00:02:47,02
of a custom cubic-bezier.

58
00:02:47,02 --> 00:02:49,08
And I'm going to give it the animation film mode of both

59
00:02:49,08 --> 00:02:52,09
since we will be adding some delays.

60
00:02:52,09 --> 00:02:55,04
To create that wave lake offset effect,

61
00:02:55,04 --> 00:02:57,04
we want each letter to start rotating up

62
00:02:57,04 --> 00:03:00,00
just slightly after the one before it.

63
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:01,02
To accomplish that,

64
00:03:01,02 --> 00:03:04,00
we'll add a delay to each letter after the first one.

65
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:08,02
And I'm going to add a very small delay of 0.2 seconds.

66
00:03:08,02 --> 00:03:11,00
We'll target each subsequent letter using the Nth child rule

67
00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:12,00
for our span.

68
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:13,07
So, this one is our second letter

69
00:03:13,07 --> 00:03:20,04
and we'll give it an animation delay of 0.2 seconds.

70
00:03:20,04 --> 00:03:22,06
And then we'll keep adding 0.2 seconds to our delay

71
00:03:22,06 --> 00:03:23,06
for each subsequent letter.

72
00:03:23,06 --> 00:03:26,07
So our third letter will have an animation delay

73
00:03:26,07 --> 00:03:31,00
of 0.4 seconds.

74
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:33,08
And I'll keep going down the list.

75
00:03:33,08 --> 00:03:36,03
If you're using a CSS pre-processor,

76
00:03:36,03 --> 00:03:39,03
you can write a loop to take care of this in one fell swoop.

77
00:03:39,03 --> 00:03:41,04
But for our example, I'm going to do it manually

78
00:03:41,04 --> 00:03:45,04
since we only have a few letters.

79
00:03:45,04 --> 00:03:46,05
With our delays in place,

80
00:03:46,05 --> 00:03:50,06
we can save and preview our animation now.

81
00:03:50,06 --> 00:03:52,08
We can see that our key frames and animation delay

82
00:03:52,08 --> 00:03:54,03
are working as expected,

83
00:03:54,03 --> 00:03:56,04
but our letters are all rotating from the middle

84
00:03:56,04 --> 00:03:59,07
of themselves which is the default behavior.

85
00:03:59,07 --> 00:04:02,01
The effect I was going for though was to have them seem

86
00:04:02,01 --> 00:04:04,03
like they're rotating from the bottom of themselves,

87
00:04:04,03 --> 00:04:07,05
as if they're sitting on a kind of imaginary floor.

88
00:04:07,05 --> 00:04:10,07
So to do that, we're going to adjust the transform origin

89
00:04:10,07 --> 00:04:13,02
for each of our letters.

90
00:04:13,02 --> 00:04:15,09
The transform origin is the point around which transforms

91
00:04:15,09 --> 00:04:16,09
are applied.

92
00:04:16,09 --> 00:04:20,00
In our case, that's the rotation on the X axis.

93
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:21,03
And we're going to move it to a point

94
00:04:21,03 --> 00:04:22,08
that's at the bottom of each letter,

95
00:04:22,08 --> 00:04:24,04
instead of the middle of each letter

96
00:04:24,04 --> 00:04:27,07
to create the effect we're going for.

97
00:04:27,07 --> 00:04:30,03
Finding the exact transform origin values you want

98
00:04:30,03 --> 00:04:32,03
often takes a bit of trial and error.

99
00:04:32,03 --> 00:04:33,05
But I've done that ahead of time

100
00:04:33,05 --> 00:04:36,02
and I know that I want to set my transform origin

101
00:04:36,02 --> 00:04:40,00
for each of these letters to 50% of the way across

102
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:41,08
each letter's bounding box

103
00:04:41,08 --> 00:04:45,02
and 70% of the way down.

104
00:04:45,02 --> 00:04:47,04
Transform origin coordinates are always measured

105
00:04:47,04 --> 00:04:50,02
from the top left when we're using percentages, pixels

106
00:04:50,02 --> 00:04:51,08
or AMS.

107
00:04:51,08 --> 00:04:55,09
So if we save that and preview our file once more,

108
00:04:55,09 --> 00:04:58,07
we see that with that transform origin adjustment

109
00:04:58,07 --> 00:05:00,06
our letters look like if they are rotating

110
00:05:00,06 --> 00:05:02,01
from the bottom of themselves

111
00:05:02,01 --> 00:05:04,06
and that creates the effect of them flipping up

112
00:05:04,06 --> 00:05:06,02
from laying on the floor which is exactly

113
00:05:06,02 --> 00:05:08,07
what we were going for.

114
00:05:08,07 --> 00:05:12,03
So that's how to use 3D Transforms and key frame animations.

115
00:05:12,03 --> 00:05:14,08
And how to use animation delay to create offsets

116
00:05:14,08 --> 00:05:17,06
when animating multiple objects.

117
00:05:17,06 --> 00:05:19,03
You can use both these techniques to create

118
00:05:19,03 --> 00:05:22,06
all sorts of animated effects on text or HTML objects

119
00:05:22,06 --> 00:05:24,00
in your own work.
