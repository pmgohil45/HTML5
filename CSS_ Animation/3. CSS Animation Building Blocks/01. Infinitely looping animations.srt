00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,03
- [Instructor] Let's look

2
00:00:01,03 --> 00:00:03,08
at creating infinitely looping animations.

3
00:00:03,08 --> 00:00:05,08
CSS is great for this type of animation

4
00:00:05,08 --> 00:00:08,00
because of how easily we can set an animation

5
00:00:08,00 --> 00:00:09,08
on an infinite loop.

6
00:00:09,08 --> 00:00:12,00
We'll be creating a couple of animated clouds

7
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:14,01
that will drift across the sky in Binaryville

8
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:16,04
just like we see here.

9
00:00:16,04 --> 00:00:19,02
Both our Binaryville logo and the clouds are images.

10
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:20,02
And in our HTML,

11
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:23,06
we have both the cloud images and the Binaryville images,

12
00:00:23,06 --> 00:00:25,02
and we've set them in different divs

13
00:00:25,02 --> 00:00:26,09
so we can absolutely position the clouds

14
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:29,04
behind the Binaryville scene.

15
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:31,09
In our CSS, we have rules to set that positioning

16
00:00:31,09 --> 00:00:35,06
and we can start to add some animation too.

17
00:00:35,06 --> 00:00:38,04
So I'm going to start by adding there at key frames block.

18
00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:40,01
And I know we want to have our clouds move

19
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:42,05
from all the way off to the left where we can't see them

20
00:00:42,05 --> 00:00:45,02
to somewhere off to the right where they're out of view.

21
00:00:45,02 --> 00:00:47,03
So I'm going to start our key frames block

22
00:00:47,03 --> 00:00:50,08
and call it float.

23
00:00:50,08 --> 00:00:52,09
Then on our 0% key frame,

24
00:00:52,09 --> 00:00:56,08
I'm going to add a transform of a translation

25
00:00:56,08 --> 00:01:00,04
on the X axis

26
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:03,00
of negative 150 pixels.

27
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:05,03
And I know from looking at my image files,

28
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:07,09
that that will move our clouds all the way off to the left

29
00:01:07,09 --> 00:01:11,00
where we can't see them.

30
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:13,05
And then for our 100% key frame,

31
00:01:13,05 --> 00:01:15,05
I'm going to move them all the way over to the right,

32
00:01:15,05 --> 00:01:17,03
or at least as far as they need to go

33
00:01:17,03 --> 00:01:20,01
to not be in view anymore.

34
00:01:20,01 --> 00:01:27,02
That'll be a translation on the X axis of 820 pixels.

35
00:01:27,02 --> 00:01:28,09
Normally it might take some trial and error

36
00:01:28,09 --> 00:01:31,02
to get these numbers right, but I figured them out

37
00:01:31,02 --> 00:01:33,09
ahead of time to save us some time here.

38
00:01:33,09 --> 00:01:35,07
So now that we have our key frames written,

39
00:01:35,07 --> 00:01:39,00
we can assign them to our two different clouds.

40
00:01:39,00 --> 00:01:42,06
Our first cloud has a class of cloud01,

41
00:01:42,06 --> 00:01:44,09
and we'll assign that cloud this float animation.

42
00:01:44,09 --> 00:01:46,00
So we'll use the shorthand.

43
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:47,05
So that's going to be animation

44
00:01:47,05 --> 00:01:50,00
and we'll give it the animation name of float.

45
00:01:50,00 --> 00:01:53,02
I'm going to give it a long duration of 25 seconds

46
00:01:53,02 --> 00:01:55,08
because this float is going to be fairly slow.

47
00:01:55,08 --> 00:01:59,05
It's just kind of an ambient cloud situation.

48
00:01:59,05 --> 00:02:01,06
I'm going to give it the easing or timing function

49
00:02:01,06 --> 00:02:04,02
of linear, just to keep this drift simple.

50
00:02:04,02 --> 00:02:08,03
And we're going to have it repeat infinitely.

51
00:02:08,03 --> 00:02:10,09
Our second cloud is cloud02

52
00:02:10,09 --> 00:02:13,03
and we're going to assign it that same set of key frames,

53
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:14,08
the float key frames,

54
00:02:14,08 --> 00:02:17,00
but we're going to change things up just a little bit

55
00:02:17,00 --> 00:02:18,09
so they'll be moving at slightly different speeds

56
00:02:18,09 --> 00:02:22,00
and won't loop exactly the same way over and over.

57
00:02:22,00 --> 00:02:25,00
So first I'll assign it that float animation again,

58
00:02:25,00 --> 00:02:26,05
but I'll give it a longer duration

59
00:02:26,05 --> 00:02:28,08
so it's moving at a different speed than cloud one.

60
00:02:28,08 --> 00:02:31,07
I'll give it a duration of 30 seconds.

61
00:02:31,07 --> 00:02:35,00
And I'll also add a delay in our animation shorthand,

62
00:02:35,00 --> 00:02:37,01
the second number with time associated with it

63
00:02:37,01 --> 00:02:38,07
will be the animation delay

64
00:02:38,07 --> 00:02:40,08
so they don't start at exactly the same time,

65
00:02:40,08 --> 00:02:44,00
just offset their movement a little bit.

66
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:45,08
I'll also give this one the easing of linear

67
00:02:45,08 --> 00:02:47,05
for the same reason as the first

68
00:02:47,05 --> 00:02:50,08
and give it the animation iteration count of infinite

69
00:02:50,08 --> 00:02:53,01
so that is looping infinitely.

70
00:02:53,01 --> 00:02:55,08
The difference in speed and the offset and timing

71
00:02:55,08 --> 00:02:57,08
will help make the clouds look slightly different

72
00:02:57,08 --> 00:02:59,06
each time they pass through our view

73
00:02:59,06 --> 00:03:02,05
and make the looping effect more interesting.

74
00:03:02,05 --> 00:03:04,07
One last thing we'll add to cloud two

75
00:03:04,07 --> 00:03:08,00
is the animation film mode of backwards.

76
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:08,08
And this will ensure

77
00:03:08,08 --> 00:03:10,08
that we don't see cloud two hanging out

78
00:03:10,08 --> 00:03:13,08
in its intrinsic position before the key frames take place

79
00:03:13,08 --> 00:03:16,02
during that five second delay.

80
00:03:16,02 --> 00:03:20,05
If we save this and preview our animation now,

81
00:03:20,05 --> 00:03:23,00
our two clouds float through Binaryville

82
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:24,09
and behave just a little bit differently

83
00:03:24,09 --> 00:03:25,08
despite the fact

84
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:29,05
that they're using the exact same key frames.

85
00:03:29,05 --> 00:03:31,08
We've also used the different durations

86
00:03:31,08 --> 00:03:33,09
and the offset in time with the delay

87
00:03:33,09 --> 00:03:35,08
to create a little bit of difference

88
00:03:35,08 --> 00:03:39,00
each time they come through the scene.

89
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:40,06
Being able to reuse animations

90
00:03:40,06 --> 00:03:42,04
on multiple elements like this is a nice feature

91
00:03:42,04 --> 00:03:44,09
of CSS animations.

92
00:03:44,09 --> 00:03:47,04
Animating multiple elements with the same key frames,

93
00:03:47,04 --> 00:03:49,08
but slightly different properties is a great way

94
00:03:49,08 --> 00:03:52,09
to get extra mileage out of your key frame animations.

95
00:03:52,09 --> 00:03:54,07
You can create all sorts of different effects

96
00:03:54,07 --> 00:03:58,00
without ever needing to edit a single key frame at all.
