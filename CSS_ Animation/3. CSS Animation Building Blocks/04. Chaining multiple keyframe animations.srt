00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,06
- [Tutor] So far, we've been creating

2
00:00:01,06 --> 00:00:04,05
mostly individual animations to create our effects,

3
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:05,06
but in practice,

4
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:07,08
you might want to combine multiple animations

5
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,08
to create the overall movement you're going for.

6
00:00:10,08 --> 00:00:11,06
In this video,

7
00:00:11,06 --> 00:00:14,03
we'll be adding to our up and over text animation

8
00:00:14,03 --> 00:00:16,06
and we'll create one more set of key frames

9
00:00:16,06 --> 00:00:20,09
to handle the over part of the up and over motion.

10
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:24,08
And the letters will end up hanging upside down.

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,00
Our HTML and CSS

12
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:28,07
are the same as we left them in the last video.

13
00:00:28,07 --> 00:00:30,04
So let's head straight to our CSS

14
00:00:30,04 --> 00:00:34,00
to add in the second set of key frames for us to use.

15
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:35,03
For this set of key frames,

16
00:00:35,03 --> 00:00:37,06
I want the letters to flip down towards me,

17
00:00:37,06 --> 00:00:39,03
so they end up upside down.

18
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:41,03
That's going to be a rotation on the X axis

19
00:00:41,03 --> 00:00:44,09
of negative 180 degrees.

20
00:00:44,09 --> 00:00:46,08
So I'll start this new set of key frames.

21
00:00:46,08 --> 00:00:51,03
I'm going to call it flipDown.

22
00:00:51,03 --> 00:00:53,02
And since we'll be using this set of key frames

23
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:56,00
to pick up right where the last set of key frames left off,

24
00:00:56,00 --> 00:00:58,00
we can skip straight to the two key frame

25
00:00:58,00 --> 00:01:00,07
or the end state of our animation.

26
00:01:00,07 --> 00:01:04,04
So our two key frame will be a rotation on the X axis

27
00:01:04,04 --> 00:01:06,07
of negative 180 degrees.

28
00:01:06,07 --> 00:01:10,04
So that's flipping the letter all the way over.

29
00:01:10,04 --> 00:01:12,04
Of course, after defining those key frames,

30
00:01:12,04 --> 00:01:14,02
we'll have to assign them to our letters,

31
00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:18,01
which we did here in the span rule.

32
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:19,08
And to add a second animation to this element,

33
00:01:19,08 --> 00:01:23,00
we're going to use a comma to separate the two animations.

34
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:26,08
So we'll add a comma, and then flip down,

35
00:01:26,08 --> 00:01:30,04
we'll give it a duration of one second as well.

36
00:01:30,04 --> 00:01:34,02
And I'll use the same custom cubic-bezier.

37
00:01:34,02 --> 00:01:35,08
And I'm going to give this second animation,

38
00:01:35,08 --> 00:01:37,07
a very long delay.

39
00:01:37,07 --> 00:01:41,05
Specifically 0.275 seconds.

40
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:44,04
And I chose 2.75 seconds because that's enough time

41
00:01:44,04 --> 00:01:47,05
for all of the letters to perform their flip up animation,

42
00:01:47,05 --> 00:01:50,02
have a little bit of a pause between the two animations

43
00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:52,01
before this one takes place.

44
00:01:52,01 --> 00:01:54,05
So when we're chaining two animations on the same object,

45
00:01:54,05 --> 00:01:56,09
the way we have one happen after the other,

46
00:01:56,09 --> 00:01:58,07
is by giving the second one a delay

47
00:01:58,07 --> 00:02:01,03
that's equal to or longer than the duration

48
00:02:01,03 --> 00:02:03,04
of the first one.

49
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:05,00
Last, but not least, I'm going to give this

50
00:02:05,00 --> 00:02:08,04
animation film mode of forwards so that way our letters

51
00:02:08,04 --> 00:02:12,07
will stay flipped upside down, once the animation is over.

52
00:02:12,07 --> 00:02:15,00
We achieved the wave-like offset effect

53
00:02:15,00 --> 00:02:16,08
for the flip up animation,

54
00:02:16,08 --> 00:02:18,07
by giving each letter a slight delay

55
00:02:18,07 --> 00:02:21,00
so that each letter would start just a bit

56
00:02:21,00 --> 00:02:22,07
after the one before it.

57
00:02:22,07 --> 00:02:25,00
We can add a second delay to all of our letters

58
00:02:25,00 --> 00:02:26,06
to apply to the flip down animation,

59
00:02:26,06 --> 00:02:30,00
to get that same effect there as well.

60
00:02:30,00 --> 00:02:31,06
So I can go to my second letter

61
00:02:31,06 --> 00:02:34,01
and just like we comma separated the two animations,

62
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:37,04
we can comma separate the two animation delays

63
00:02:37,04 --> 00:02:42,00
to signify which animation each delay applies to.

64
00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:44,07
In this case, since this is my second letter,

65
00:02:44,07 --> 00:02:48,06
and I know my first letter is starting at 2.75 seconds,

66
00:02:48,06 --> 00:02:53,00
I will give my second letter a delay of 2.95 seconds

67
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:56,02
so that it starts 0.2 seconds after the first one.

68
00:02:56,02 --> 00:02:58,06
We'll use that same 0.2 second delay

69
00:02:58,06 --> 00:03:00,06
throughout second animation as well.

70
00:03:00,06 --> 00:03:03,01
And basically we just have to do a lot of adding

71
00:03:03,01 --> 00:03:05,04
for those second delays.

72
00:03:05,04 --> 00:03:11,03
So our third letter will be 3.15 seconds,

73
00:03:11,03 --> 00:03:16,06
and on down the line.

74
00:03:16,06 --> 00:03:19,04
And of course, if you're using a CSS pre-processor,

75
00:03:19,04 --> 00:03:22,01
you could write a loop to automate these values,

76
00:03:22,01 --> 00:03:23,02
but I'm doing it manually

77
00:03:23,02 --> 00:03:25,01
since I have such a short number of letters

78
00:03:25,01 --> 00:03:28,04
to add delays to.

79
00:03:28,04 --> 00:03:29,07
With all those delays in place,

80
00:03:29,07 --> 00:03:37,01
let's save and preview how our animation is looking.

81
00:03:37,01 --> 00:03:40,00
We have the flip-up animation that we established before,

82
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:42,00
then we have a little bit of a pause,

83
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:43,08
and then our second flipped down animation

84
00:03:43,08 --> 00:03:45,01
takes place on the letters,

85
00:03:45,01 --> 00:03:48,00
leaving them upside down in the end.

86
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:49,09
It's worth mentioning that we could have pulled off

87
00:03:49,09 --> 00:03:52,00
this same effect with one set of key frames,

88
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:54,04
essentially by duplicating the values in the middle

89
00:03:54,04 --> 00:03:56,00
to create a hold frame.

90
00:03:56,00 --> 00:03:58,07
But it's really up to your preference.

91
00:03:58,07 --> 00:04:00,09
Personally, I prefer to split up the animations

92
00:04:00,09 --> 00:04:03,02
because it gives me more flexibility.

93
00:04:03,02 --> 00:04:05,05
For example, with these two sets of key frames,

94
00:04:05,05 --> 00:04:07,03
if I wanted to change the delay value

95
00:04:07,03 --> 00:04:09,04
for just the flip down animation,

96
00:04:09,04 --> 00:04:12,04
that would be relatively straightforward.

97
00:04:12,04 --> 00:04:14,08
So that's how to chain multiple animations on one element

98
00:04:14,08 --> 00:04:17,08
using animation delay to space them out.

99
00:04:17,08 --> 00:04:18,07
It's a great technique

100
00:04:18,07 --> 00:04:21,00
for creating slightly more complex effects

101
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:23,06
or spacing out animations in time.

102
00:04:23,06 --> 00:04:25,09
One word of advice, though,

103
00:04:25,09 --> 00:04:28,05
if you find yourself creating a chain of animations,

104
00:04:28,05 --> 00:04:31,05
that's more than three or four long in CSS,

105
00:04:31,05 --> 00:04:33,09
that's a good time to consider moving to JavaScript

106
00:04:33,09 --> 00:04:36,02
for your animation efforts.

107
00:04:36,02 --> 00:04:37,09
Managing all those delays in order

108
00:04:37,09 --> 00:04:40,03
can get really tedious in CSS.

109
00:04:40,03 --> 00:04:42,01
And a JavaScript based animation solution,

110
00:04:42,01 --> 00:04:45,01
will allow you to control a large number of animations

111
00:04:45,01 --> 00:04:48,00
in a more robust and flexible way.
