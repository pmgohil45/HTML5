00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:07,07
- [Instructor] We've covered a lot about how CSS keyframe

2
00:00:07,07 --> 00:00:08,09
animations work.

3
00:00:08,09 --> 00:00:10,09
So for a nice followup challenge,

4
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:13,04
let's change up the keyframes for the Hello animation

5
00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:15,03
we were working on earlier.

6
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:17,08
You can use the files that you've already been working on,

7
00:00:17,08 --> 00:00:21,03
or the exercise files I provided for this challenge.

8
00:00:21,03 --> 00:00:24,03
And for this one, you can either write an entirely new set

9
00:00:24,03 --> 00:00:27,03
of keyframes or add an additional keyframe

10
00:00:27,03 --> 00:00:28,03
to what's already there.

11
00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:30,01
The choice is yours.

12
00:00:30,01 --> 00:00:31,07
This is a nice short challenge.

13
00:00:31,07 --> 00:00:33,09
You should spend about five to 10 minutes or so

14
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:35,05
adjusting your animation.

15
00:00:35,05 --> 00:00:39,00
And then watch the solution video to see what I made.
