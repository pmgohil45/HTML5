00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:07,00
- [Instructor] Here's my solution to the adding

2
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:08,04
key frames challenge.

3
00:00:08,04 --> 00:00:10,09
I replaced our scale in effect with a bit of

4
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:12,09
a wiggle effect.

5
00:00:12,09 --> 00:00:15,09
Here's what I did in the CSS.

6
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:18,03
I created a new set of key frames and called it wiggle

7
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:21,00
since I was making a bit of a wiggle effect.

8
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:23,08
And in the key frames, I adjusted both the translation

9
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:26,02
on the X axis and the rotation to give it just a little bit

10
00:00:26,02 --> 00:00:30,03
of a movement and a bit of a rotation back and forth.

11
00:00:30,03 --> 00:00:33,05
Another thing I changed was the transform origin over h2.

12
00:00:33,05 --> 00:00:35,07
And that makes the rotation look just a bit different

13
00:00:35,07 --> 00:00:38,07
because we're rotating from a slightly different point.

14
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:40,09
Then I applied the animation of wiggle.

15
00:00:40,09 --> 00:00:43,09
I gave it a quite short duration since wiggles generally

16
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:45,05
happen kind of quickly.

17
00:00:45,05 --> 00:00:48,02
Had it repeat infinitely and used this cubic-bezier

18
00:00:48,02 --> 00:00:49,02
for the easing.

19
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:52,04
There's no right or wrong answer for this challenge.

20
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:55,00
So whatever you did to adjust the key frames and create a

21
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:58,00
slightly different effect, you're on the right track.
