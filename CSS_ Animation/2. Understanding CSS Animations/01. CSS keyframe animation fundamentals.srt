00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,03
- [Narrator] Let's get started with some

2
00:00:01,03 --> 00:00:03,06
CSS keyframe animation.

3
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:06,02
In this lesson, we'll create a simple animation

4
00:00:06,02 --> 00:00:08,05
of tech scaling up into view with a little bit

5
00:00:08,05 --> 00:00:11,04
of an overshoot to demonstrate the main components

6
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:14,05
of CSS keyframe animations.

7
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:17,02
The HTML behind our example is pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:21,02
Our text is in H2 sitting within our container div.

9
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:25,01
If we move to our CSS file, we have some text sizing rules

10
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:29,05
and some basic positioning going on, and that's about it.

11
00:00:29,05 --> 00:00:31,09
So let's start adding some animation.

12
00:00:31,09 --> 00:00:35,04
There are two main parts to any CSS animation.

13
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:37,05
We need to define the animation keyframes

14
00:00:37,05 --> 00:00:40,03
in the @keyframes rule, and then we need to assign

15
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:44,02
those keyframes to a specific element or elements.

16
00:00:44,02 --> 00:00:46,07
You can do these two steps in any order,

17
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:49,02
but I prefer to define the animation first

18
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:51,07
and then assign it to something.

19
00:00:51,07 --> 00:00:53,08
So moving to our CSS file,

20
00:00:53,08 --> 00:00:56,01
we'll start by creating our CSS animation

21
00:00:56,01 --> 00:01:00,03
by defining its keyframes using the @keyframes rule.

22
00:01:00,03 --> 00:01:02,06
And we'll give this animation a name because otherwise

23
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:04,02
we won't be able to assign it later,

24
00:01:04,02 --> 00:01:05,08
and we'll call this one scaleIn

25
00:01:05,08 --> 00:01:09,06
because that's essentially the effect we're creating.

26
00:01:09,06 --> 00:01:11,05
Once we have our @keyframes block,

27
00:01:11,05 --> 00:01:13,08
we define the values for the animating properties

28
00:01:13,08 --> 00:01:16,04
at various points during the animation.

29
00:01:16,04 --> 00:01:18,03
Any property that you want to have changed

30
00:01:18,03 --> 00:01:20,05
over the course of one cycle of the animation

31
00:01:20,05 --> 00:01:23,07
needs to be listed in your keyframes.

32
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:26,01
There are multiple options available for how to define

33
00:01:26,01 --> 00:01:28,08
the keyframes within your @keyframes rule.

34
00:01:28,08 --> 00:01:31,02
We can use key words like to and from

35
00:01:31,02 --> 00:01:33,02
for keyframe animations that are animating

36
00:01:33,02 --> 00:01:35,06
only between two states, but in my case

37
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:38,00
I'm going to use percentages to define my keyframes

38
00:01:38,00 --> 00:01:40,01
for maximum flexibility.

39
00:01:40,01 --> 00:01:42,08
The 0% keyframe or the "from" keyframe

40
00:01:42,08 --> 00:01:44,09
represents the start of the animation

41
00:01:44,09 --> 00:01:48,00
and the 100% keyframe or the "to" keyframe

42
00:01:48,00 --> 00:01:50,05
represents the end state of the animation.

43
00:01:50,05 --> 00:01:52,07
And we can use percentage values in between

44
00:01:52,07 --> 00:01:55,03
to define as many additional stages of the animation

45
00:01:55,03 --> 00:01:57,08
as we want along the way.

46
00:01:57,08 --> 00:02:00,03
So I'm going to start our text at a small size,

47
00:02:00,03 --> 00:02:03,09
say 20% of its full size or a scale of 0.2

48
00:02:03,09 --> 00:02:07,09
for our 0% keyframe.

49
00:02:07,09 --> 00:02:09,07
For this effect, I know I want it to grow

50
00:02:09,07 --> 00:02:12,03
to be a bit oversized before it animates

51
00:02:12,03 --> 00:02:14,01
back to its intrinsic size

52
00:02:14,01 --> 00:02:16,04
to give it a bit of that overshoot feel.

53
00:02:16,04 --> 00:02:21,01
So we'll add a scale of 1.1 or 110% of the given size

54
00:02:21,01 --> 00:02:24,04
at the 85% keyframe.

55
00:02:24,04 --> 00:02:26,03
And then, at the end of the animation

56
00:02:26,03 --> 00:02:28,03
I want things to go back to their given size

57
00:02:28,03 --> 00:02:30,03
or a scale of one,

58
00:02:30,03 --> 00:02:33,07
so that will be our 100% keyframe.

59
00:02:33,07 --> 00:02:36,04
And that completes our @keyframes block.

60
00:02:36,04 --> 00:02:38,03
But if we previewed our file right now,

61
00:02:38,03 --> 00:02:39,05
nothing would happen.

62
00:02:39,05 --> 00:02:41,08
There would be no animation to see.

63
00:02:41,08 --> 00:02:44,00
We've defined the keyframes for our animation

64
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:46,06
but we still need to assign it to a specific element

65
00:02:46,06 --> 00:02:49,00
in order to see it in action.

66
00:02:49,00 --> 00:02:51,01
To assign an animation to an element,

67
00:02:51,01 --> 00:02:53,09
we give that element some additional CSS properties.

68
00:02:53,09 --> 00:02:56,09
So in this case, that's our H2.

69
00:02:56,09 --> 00:03:01,04
The first one we'll need to define is the animation name

70
00:03:01,04 --> 00:03:03,09
and we'll set this to be the same thing we called

71
00:03:03,09 --> 00:03:06,01
our keyframe block.

72
00:03:06,01 --> 00:03:08,01
And this is essentially saying to our H2,

73
00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:10,07
hey, use this specific set of keyframes,

74
00:03:10,07 --> 00:03:13,05
the one we called scaleIn.

75
00:03:13,05 --> 00:03:15,07
The second property we absolutely have to add

76
00:03:15,07 --> 00:03:20,04
is animation duration.

77
00:03:20,04 --> 00:03:22,06
Our keyframe block defines what will change

78
00:03:22,06 --> 00:03:24,03
over the course of the animation

79
00:03:24,03 --> 00:03:26,06
but we need to tell it how long to take as well.

80
00:03:26,06 --> 00:03:30,01
So let's set this to two seconds.

81
00:03:30,01 --> 00:03:31,07
Now when we preview our file

82
00:03:31,07 --> 00:03:33,05
we see some animation happening.

83
00:03:33,05 --> 00:03:35,05
We've just set the minimum needed to create

84
00:03:35,05 --> 00:03:37,05
a CSS keyframe animation.

85
00:03:37,05 --> 00:03:39,09
We've got the keyframes, we assigned it to an element

86
00:03:39,09 --> 00:03:42,01
and we set a duration.

87
00:03:42,01 --> 00:03:45,02
So now we've completed our first CSS keyframe animation,

88
00:03:45,02 --> 00:03:47,06
our title scales up with a bit of an overshoot

89
00:03:47,06 --> 00:03:49,03
and it's looking pretty neat.

90
00:03:49,03 --> 00:03:51,02
Next, we'll look at some additional properties

91
00:03:51,02 --> 00:03:54,00
that let us fine tune our animations for even more control

92
00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:55,00
over the effect.
