00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:01,08
- [Instructor] Let's look at how properties

2
00:00:01,08 --> 00:00:04,03
like animation-delay and animation-fill-mode

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:07,03
can help us do more with our key frame animations.

4
00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:10,02
Both of these properties are ones I use a lot in my work

5
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:13,01
and I bet you'll find them super useful too.

6
00:00:13,01 --> 00:00:15,00
We'll start with animation-delay.

7
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:16,07
It works exactly like transition-delay

8
00:00:16,07 --> 00:00:20,02
except it's applied to key frame animations.

9
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:23,00
Animation-delay lets you specify a certain amount of time

10
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:25,07
that should pass before the key frame animation takes effect

11
00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:28,06
on the object you've applied it to.

12
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:30,03
Let's add a delay to the text animation

13
00:00:30,03 --> 00:00:33,06
we've been working on to see how it works.

14
00:00:33,06 --> 00:00:37,03
We'll go to our h2 rule and add one more animation property,

15
00:00:37,03 --> 00:00:41,01
and that property is animation-delay,

16
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:43,00
and I'll give it a delay of five seconds,

17
00:00:43,00 --> 00:00:45,08
which is probably excessively long in most cases,

18
00:00:45,08 --> 00:00:49,05
but that way, we'll really be able to see what's happening.

19
00:00:49,05 --> 00:00:51,00
Now when we refresh the page,

20
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:54,03
there's a five second delay before animation starts.

21
00:00:54,03 --> 00:00:57,04
However, it might not look exactly how you expected.

22
00:00:57,04 --> 00:00:58,08
We see the text at full size

23
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:02,01
for those five seconds of the animation-delay.

24
00:01:02,01 --> 00:01:05,04
The first key frame of our animation, that 0% key frame,

25
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:09,06
has styles to scale the text down to 20% of its normal size,

26
00:01:09,06 --> 00:01:12,00
but that key frame styles are only applied

27
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:16,06
once the animation starts, not during any initial delay.

28
00:01:16,06 --> 00:01:18,07
So that's why we see the text at full size

29
00:01:18,07 --> 00:01:20,02
during those five seconds delay,

30
00:01:20,02 --> 00:01:22,06
even though that's not where the animation starts,

31
00:01:22,06 --> 00:01:27,03
and it's also where animation-fill-mode comes in handy.

32
00:01:27,03 --> 00:01:30,01
The animation-fill-mode property essentially describes

33
00:01:30,01 --> 00:01:33,02
how time around the animations actively play in duration

34
00:01:33,02 --> 00:01:34,08
should be handled.

35
00:01:34,08 --> 00:01:37,02
That means it lets you control what happens

36
00:01:37,02 --> 00:01:39,09
during the delays before an animation starts

37
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:44,04
and also what happens after an animation's duration ends.

38
00:01:44,04 --> 00:01:46,06
So if we go back to our CSS,

39
00:01:46,06 --> 00:01:49,02
in addition to the animation-delay property,

40
00:01:49,02 --> 00:01:53,07
I'm going to add an animation-fill-mode value of backwards.

41
00:01:53,07 --> 00:01:56,00
The animation-fill-mode value of backwards

42
00:01:56,00 --> 00:01:58,09
means that the styles from the animation's first key frame,

43
00:01:58,09 --> 00:02:01,02
in this case, the 0% key frame,

44
00:02:01,02 --> 00:02:03,03
will be applied backwards in time

45
00:02:03,03 --> 00:02:06,09
to fill the time during our delay.

46
00:02:06,09 --> 00:02:09,00
Now when we preview our text animation,

47
00:02:09,00 --> 00:02:10,09
we see the behavior we were expecting

48
00:02:10,09 --> 00:02:13,09
during that five second delay at the beginning.

49
00:02:13,09 --> 00:02:16,02
I bet you're starting to see why animation-delay

50
00:02:16,02 --> 00:02:18,01
and animation-fill-mode are two properties

51
00:02:18,01 --> 00:02:20,00
that are used together so often.
