00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:02,09
- [Instructor] Animation-film-mode is a very useful property

2
00:00:02,09 --> 00:00:07,08
for CSS animation, but it can be a bit confusing at first.

3
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:09,01
The way I like to think of it

4
00:00:09,01 --> 00:00:10,09
is that the animation-film-mode property

5
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:16,02
determines how the time around an animation is filled in.

6
00:00:16,02 --> 00:00:18,07
Animation-film-mode is set to none by default,

7
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:21,08
which is why you might notice that certain CSS animations

8
00:00:21,08 --> 00:00:25,00
like this one here, jump back to their starting position

9
00:00:25,00 --> 00:00:27,02
after an animation that moves them somewhere else

10
00:00:27,02 --> 00:00:29,05
has completed.

11
00:00:29,05 --> 00:00:32,00
The key frames behind that robot animation,

12
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:33,08
tell it to start from where it is

13
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:36,02
and to move 900 pixels to the right.

14
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:38,00
But once it finishes playing,

15
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:40,03
the robot goes right back to where it was

16
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:42,05
and that feels really weird at first.

17
00:00:42,05 --> 00:00:44,04
I mean, we just told that to go over there,

18
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:46,05
but now it went back here,

19
00:00:46,05 --> 00:00:48,06
and you might notice a similar behavior

20
00:00:48,06 --> 00:00:52,07
during animation delays like we saw in the last video.

21
00:00:52,07 --> 00:00:55,04
The reason for all this is that CSS animations

22
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:57,02
are temporal in nature.

23
00:00:57,02 --> 00:00:59,05
Once the duration of the animation completes,

24
00:00:59,05 --> 00:01:01,06
the styles in that animations key frames

25
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:04,06
are no longer acting on the element they animated.

26
00:01:04,06 --> 00:01:07,05
That is, not unless we use animation-film-mode

27
00:01:07,05 --> 00:01:09,09
to specify we want them to.

28
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:12,06
If you want your animating element to take on the styles

29
00:01:12,06 --> 00:01:14,07
of the first keyframe of an animation,

30
00:01:14,07 --> 00:01:16,02
in other words, if you want it to look

31
00:01:16,02 --> 00:01:18,09
like the first keyframes property's already applied

32
00:01:18,09 --> 00:01:20,06
during an animation delay,

33
00:01:20,06 --> 00:01:24,00
set your animation-film-mode to backwards.

34
00:01:24,00 --> 00:01:25,08
That will take the styling from the first keyframe

35
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:29,01
in the animation and kind of pull it backwards in time

36
00:01:29,01 --> 00:01:31,05
during the animation delay.

37
00:01:31,05 --> 00:01:34,00
On the other hand, if you want your animating element

38
00:01:34,00 --> 00:01:36,00
to stay in place once an animation that moves it

39
00:01:36,00 --> 00:01:38,02
has finished, or in other words,

40
00:01:38,02 --> 00:01:40,01
you want the element to keep the properties

41
00:01:40,01 --> 00:01:42,04
defined in the last keyframe of the animation

42
00:01:42,04 --> 00:01:44,06
past the animation's duration,

43
00:01:44,06 --> 00:01:47,06
set your animation-film-mode property to forwards.

44
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:49,05
That essentially takes the styles

45
00:01:49,05 --> 00:01:51,05
from the last keyframe of the animation

46
00:01:51,05 --> 00:01:53,03
and pushes them forward in time

47
00:01:53,03 --> 00:01:54,09
or holds them forward in time.

48
00:01:54,09 --> 00:01:57,02
However you prefer to think about it.

49
00:01:57,02 --> 00:01:59,01
Conveniently, animation-film-mode

50
00:01:59,01 --> 00:02:01,00
also has the option of both.

51
00:02:01,00 --> 00:02:04,09
Which gives the behavior of forwards and backwards combined.

52
00:02:04,09 --> 00:02:07,09
Personally, I tend to use both most often.

53
00:02:07,09 --> 00:02:09,09
And I'll even assign it to all my animations

54
00:02:09,09 --> 00:02:11,02
when I'm prototyping something

55
00:02:11,02 --> 00:02:13,03
even if I'm not sure I need it yet.

56
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:14,08
It saves me that extra step

57
00:02:14,08 --> 00:02:16,04
of wondering why things look funny

58
00:02:16,04 --> 00:02:19,00
and having to go back and add it in later.

59
00:02:19,00 --> 00:02:21,08
You might find that to be a helpful trick too.

60
00:02:21,08 --> 00:02:24,08
In any case, know that if the element you're animating

61
00:02:24,08 --> 00:02:27,05
isn't looking quite right during any animation delay

62
00:02:27,05 --> 00:02:29,09
or after the animation has finished,

63
00:02:29,09 --> 00:02:31,05
the animation-film-mode property

64
00:02:31,05 --> 00:02:34,00
will most likely fix that for you.
