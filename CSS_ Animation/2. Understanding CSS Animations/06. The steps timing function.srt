00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,06
- [Tutor] We have one last timing function to look at,

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:04,07
and that's the steps function.

3
00:00:04,07 --> 00:00:06,09
Steps work a little differently than our other options

4
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:08,07
for animation timing functions.

5
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:11,02
And they can seem a little confusing at first,

6
00:00:11,02 --> 00:00:13,01
but here's how I like to picture it.

7
00:00:13,01 --> 00:00:15,09
The steps function essentially splits the total duration

8
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:18,08
of your animation into equal blocks of time.

9
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:21,00
Each one of those blocks is a step.

10
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:23,08
Each of those tiny blocks also take up some amount of time,

11
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:26,05
even if it's just a fraction of a second.

12
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:28,04
So instead of continuous motion,

13
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:31,08
your animation is divided up into a series of holds

14
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:34,05
something like this.

15
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:37,02
And you can use the jumpstart and jump and keywords

16
00:00:37,02 --> 00:00:41,01
for finer control over how the whole effect behaves.

17
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:43,07
Let's create a typing on effect animation

18
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:46,07
to get a feel for how steps works.

19
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:49,01
The basis of this effect is to animate the width

20
00:00:49,01 --> 00:00:51,03
of our H1 to reveal the letters one at a time

21
00:00:51,03 --> 00:00:53,01
as if they're typing on.

22
00:00:53,01 --> 00:00:54,08
And that one at a time part,

23
00:00:54,08 --> 00:00:57,06
is what steps will make possible.

24
00:00:57,06 --> 00:00:59,03
So I already have things partly started

25
00:00:59,03 --> 00:01:00,06
and I've written some key frames

26
00:01:00,06 --> 00:01:03,01
that we'll use to animate the cursor blinking.

27
00:01:03,01 --> 00:01:06,00
But we still need some key frames to make the type on effect

28
00:01:06,00 --> 00:01:09,07
and essentially reveal the h1, one letter at a time.

29
00:01:09,07 --> 00:01:12,03
So I'll start my @keyframes block,

30
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:16,00
and I'm going to call this animation typing.

31
00:01:16,00 --> 00:01:17,03
And we'll set up these key frames,

32
00:01:17,03 --> 00:01:20,03
very similar to how we've done in previous examples.

33
00:01:20,03 --> 00:01:22,04
We want to start our h1 with a width of zero.

34
00:01:22,04 --> 00:01:28,03
So our 0% key frame, we'll set the width of zero pixels,

35
00:01:28,03 --> 00:01:30,07
and then we want it to end at its full size.

36
00:01:30,07 --> 00:01:33,06
So start being basically invisible 'cause it's so thin

37
00:01:33,06 --> 00:01:36,03
and end being wide enough to see all the letters.

38
00:01:36,03 --> 00:01:38,04
So that's our 100% key frame

39
00:01:38,04 --> 00:01:43,08
and we'll set the width there at 100%.

40
00:01:43,08 --> 00:01:44,09
With those key frames in place.

41
00:01:44,09 --> 00:01:47,07
We'll assign this animation to our h1.

42
00:01:47,07 --> 00:01:50,03
So we'll give it the animation name of typing,

43
00:01:50,03 --> 00:01:53,00
like we just had below.

44
00:01:53,00 --> 00:01:59,03
And we'll give it an animation duration of three seconds

45
00:01:59,03 --> 00:02:00,02
and we'll additionally,

46
00:02:00,02 --> 00:02:05,04
give it the animation timing function of steps.

47
00:02:05,04 --> 00:02:07,06
Now we have to give it a number of steps to take.

48
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:09,09
And in this case we have 14 letters.

49
00:02:09,09 --> 00:02:14,01
So I'm going to use 14 steps, one for each letter.

50
00:02:14,01 --> 00:02:18,01
So if I save that and preview our file,

51
00:02:18,01 --> 00:02:20,02
we start to see our typing on effect.

52
00:02:20,02 --> 00:02:23,04
The letters are appearing one at a time as the h1 expands

53
00:02:23,04 --> 00:02:26,00
and that's thanks to the steps function.

54
00:02:26,00 --> 00:02:27,05
There's one more thing we want to add

55
00:02:27,05 --> 00:02:28,06
to get this full effect.

56
00:02:28,06 --> 00:02:30,02
And that's the blinking cursor.

57
00:02:30,02 --> 00:02:31,08
Right now, it's just kind of hanging out.

58
00:02:31,08 --> 00:02:33,06
So let's give it an animation as well.

59
00:02:33,06 --> 00:02:36,09
And we'll also use steps to get that blinking effect.

60
00:02:36,09 --> 00:02:39,05
So we'll go back to our CSS.

61
00:02:39,05 --> 00:02:41,00
And what we're going to do,

62
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:42,06
is apply both the blinking key frames

63
00:02:42,06 --> 00:02:45,02
and the typing key frames to our h1.

64
00:02:45,02 --> 00:02:47,07
The typing will adjust the width to show the letters

65
00:02:47,07 --> 00:02:49,09
and the blinking will adjust the border color

66
00:02:49,09 --> 00:02:52,07
on the far right side to create our cursor.

67
00:02:52,07 --> 00:02:55,00
When we're applying more than one animation to an element,

68
00:02:55,00 --> 00:02:55,09
it becomes a lot easier

69
00:02:55,09 --> 00:02:58,09
if we start using the animation shorthand.

70
00:02:58,09 --> 00:03:01,01
So I'm going to take what we've got right here

71
00:03:01,01 --> 00:03:03,01
and replace it with the shorthand version,

72
00:03:03,01 --> 00:03:06,04
to make it easier to add the second animation as well.

73
00:03:06,04 --> 00:03:07,05
So, for our shorthand version,

74
00:03:07,05 --> 00:03:09,09
we're going to use the animation property,

75
00:03:09,09 --> 00:03:12,07
and we're going to give it the animation name of typing.

76
00:03:12,07 --> 00:03:14,09
We'll give it a duration of three seconds.

77
00:03:14,09 --> 00:03:15,08
The first number

78
00:03:15,08 --> 00:03:18,00
with time associated with it in the shorthand

79
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:19,05
will be used as the duration.

80
00:03:19,05 --> 00:03:20,07
And we know we want three seconds.

81
00:03:20,07 --> 00:03:22,02
That's what we used before.

82
00:03:22,02 --> 00:03:25,05
And I'll give it the animation timing function of steps.

83
00:03:25,05 --> 00:03:29,01
And we use 14 there before, so we'll use 14 there again.

84
00:03:29,01 --> 00:03:31,04
So this is the shorthand version of what we had written

85
00:03:31,04 --> 00:03:33,05
a few seconds ago.

86
00:03:33,05 --> 00:03:36,05
Now I'll a comma here to separate our two animations.

87
00:03:36,05 --> 00:03:37,06
And I like to move to a new line

88
00:03:37,06 --> 00:03:39,08
because it just makes it easier to read,

89
00:03:39,08 --> 00:03:42,08
but that is completely optional.

90
00:03:42,08 --> 00:03:45,02
So I'll add a second animation of blinking.

91
00:03:45,02 --> 00:03:46,05
That's going to be for the cursor,

92
00:03:46,05 --> 00:03:48,07
which is a border on our h1.

93
00:03:48,07 --> 00:03:51,07
We're going to give it a duration of 0.5 seconds

94
00:03:51,07 --> 00:03:54,05
because the blinking is going to happen rather quickly.

95
00:03:54,05 --> 00:03:56,05
And we'll give it the animation timing function

96
00:03:56,05 --> 00:03:58,03
also of steps.

97
00:03:58,03 --> 00:04:01,00
And we're going to give this one, a step of one.

98
00:04:01,00 --> 00:04:04,05
And we'll also tell it to repeat infinitely.

99
00:04:04,05 --> 00:04:07,03
So that's essentially the animation iteration count

100
00:04:07,03 --> 00:04:08,04
of infinite.

101
00:04:08,04 --> 00:04:10,03
Because to look like a real cursor,

102
00:04:10,03 --> 00:04:13,05
we want to have it blinking even after we stop typing.

103
00:04:13,05 --> 00:04:16,08
So if we save this and preview it now,

104
00:04:16,08 --> 00:04:18,08
we have our letters showing up one at a time

105
00:04:18,08 --> 00:04:22,00
typing on thanks to our typing key frames animation.

106
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:23,02
And we have the cursor blinking

107
00:04:23,02 --> 00:04:26,00
thanks to our blinking animation.

108
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:30,04
Both of which are powered by the steps timing function.

109
00:04:30,04 --> 00:04:31,03
So that's our quick look

110
00:04:31,03 --> 00:04:33,01
at the steps function for CSS animation

111
00:04:33,01 --> 00:04:36,04
and the sort of look it can give your animations.

112
00:04:36,04 --> 00:04:38,03
Steps don't tend to get used as often

113
00:04:38,03 --> 00:04:40,00
as other timing functions,

114
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:42,00
but it's still good to know about for those times

115
00:04:42,00 --> 00:04:44,00
when it's the right solution for what you need.
