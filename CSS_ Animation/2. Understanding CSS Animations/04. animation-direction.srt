00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,04
- [Instructor] We've been talking about

2
00:00:01,04 --> 00:00:04,00
the various properties outside of the keyframe definition

3
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:07,08
that we can use to change how an animation looks.

4
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,00
One of those properties that can be especially useful

5
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:12,08
for this is animation-direction.

6
00:00:12,08 --> 00:00:15,03
Animation-direction lets us manipulate what order

7
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:17,02
our keyframes are executed in,

8
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:18,06
and we have a few different values

9
00:00:18,06 --> 00:00:21,03
to choose from for this property.

10
00:00:21,03 --> 00:00:23,07
We can set the animation-direction to normal,

11
00:00:23,07 --> 00:00:26,04
which is default or reverse

12
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:30,06
or alternate or alternate-reverse.

13
00:00:30,06 --> 00:00:33,01
Animation-direction is easiest to demonstrate

14
00:00:33,01 --> 00:00:34,05
by animating position,

15
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:36,07
like the animation we're looking at here.

16
00:00:36,07 --> 00:00:38,05
But now that this property can be applied

17
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:40,09
with any CSS keyframe animations,

18
00:00:40,09 --> 00:00:43,05
not just one's animating position.

19
00:00:43,05 --> 00:00:45,07
Right now, we've got our robot moving across the screen

20
00:00:45,07 --> 00:00:49,08
from left to right using this set of keyframes.

21
00:00:49,08 --> 00:00:52,09
You might notice the lack of a 0% keyframe here.

22
00:00:52,09 --> 00:00:54,03
That's a handy trick you can use

23
00:00:54,03 --> 00:00:57,00
when you want an object 0% keyframe styles

24
00:00:57,00 --> 00:00:58,08
to be the same as whatever styles

25
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:01,07
are currently applied to that object.

26
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:03,09
If there's no 0% keyframe present,

27
00:01:03,09 --> 00:01:07,02
the current styles applied to the object are used instead.

28
00:01:07,02 --> 00:01:08,06
So our robot image starts

29
00:01:08,06 --> 00:01:11,00
from where it was positioned intrinsically on the page

30
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:13,09
and animates a distance 700 times its width

31
00:01:13,09 --> 00:01:16,08
on the X axis to the right.

32
00:01:16,08 --> 00:01:19,02
If we look at the properties applied to our robot image,

33
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:20,06
you'll notice two things.

34
00:01:20,06 --> 00:01:23,07
The first is this animation iteration count of three,

35
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:25,00
which is why we saw our robot

36
00:01:25,00 --> 00:01:27,04
moving across the screen three times,

37
00:01:27,04 --> 00:01:28,08
and you'll also notice that we have

38
00:01:28,08 --> 00:01:31,08
no animation-direction set.

39
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:33,09
So we're seeing it animate with the default value

40
00:01:33,09 --> 00:01:35,09
of normal for animation-direction,

41
00:01:35,09 --> 00:01:38,08
which in this case is from left to right.

42
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:41,06
If we want our keyframes to execute in the opposite order

43
00:01:41,06 --> 00:01:43,05
and have the animation play in reverse,

44
00:01:43,05 --> 00:01:46,03
in that case, this would mean going from right to left.

45
00:01:46,03 --> 00:01:50,02
We can add the animation-direction property of reverse,

46
00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:51,09
and when we preview our robot now,

47
00:01:51,09 --> 00:01:54,01
it's moving in the opposite direction.

48
00:01:54,01 --> 00:01:55,00
That's pretty neat,

49
00:01:55,00 --> 00:01:57,01
especially because we didn't have to adjust

50
00:01:57,01 --> 00:02:00,06
any of the keyframe values to make this happen.

51
00:02:00,06 --> 00:02:01,09
Of course, we aren't going to stop there.

52
00:02:01,09 --> 00:02:03,06
We have two more possible values

53
00:02:03,06 --> 00:02:06,03
for animation-direction to compare.

54
00:02:06,03 --> 00:02:08,06
Let's give our robot the animation-direction value

55
00:02:08,06 --> 00:02:10,06
of alternate instead.

56
00:02:10,06 --> 00:02:13,09
Now this is one where animation iteration count of three

57
00:02:13,09 --> 00:02:15,07
is very important.

58
00:02:15,07 --> 00:02:18,01
To use the animation-direction of alternate,

59
00:02:18,01 --> 00:02:20,06
you need to have more than one iteration happening

60
00:02:20,06 --> 00:02:22,06
and you'll see why in a second.

61
00:02:22,06 --> 00:02:26,00
When we save and preview our robot now,

62
00:02:26,00 --> 00:02:28,04
you'll notice that the robot is moving forwards

63
00:02:28,04 --> 00:02:31,02
and then backwards and then forwards again.

64
00:02:31,02 --> 00:02:33,02
It's alternating its direction

65
00:02:33,02 --> 00:02:35,05
each time the animation executes.

66
00:02:35,05 --> 00:02:36,06
That's why it's so important

67
00:02:36,06 --> 00:02:40,06
to have an animation iteration count higher than one.

68
00:02:40,06 --> 00:02:41,06
Last but not least,

69
00:02:41,06 --> 00:02:43,07
we'll assign our robot the animation-direction

70
00:02:43,07 --> 00:02:47,00
of alternate-reverse.

71
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:49,02
When we save and preview that,

72
00:02:49,02 --> 00:02:51,01
this gives us the same back and forth motion

73
00:02:51,01 --> 00:02:52,02
as the last time,

74
00:02:52,02 --> 00:02:53,08
except this time it starts playing

75
00:02:53,08 --> 00:02:58,02
the reverse direction first and then the normal direction.

76
00:02:58,02 --> 00:02:59,03
Again, it's important

77
00:02:59,03 --> 00:03:01,02
for the animation iteration count property

78
00:03:01,02 --> 00:03:02,06
to be higher than one,

79
00:03:02,06 --> 00:03:04,01
otherwise there wouldn't be anything

80
00:03:04,01 --> 00:03:06,06
to alternate and reverse.

81
00:03:06,06 --> 00:03:09,00
Now you know the power of animation-direction

82
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:11,02
and how it can change up the look of your animation

83
00:03:11,02 --> 00:03:14,00
without having to edit the underlying keyframes.

84
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:16,02
It's a property I'm sure you'll be using a lot

85
00:03:16,02 --> 00:03:18,00
in your CSS animation work.
