00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,01
- [Instructor] Both Chrome and Firefox browsers

2
00:00:02,01 --> 00:00:04,04
have some very useful animation debugging tools

3
00:00:04,04 --> 00:00:06,04
within their developer tools.

4
00:00:06,04 --> 00:00:08,01
These tools can be extremely helpful

5
00:00:08,01 --> 00:00:12,00
both in debugging and designing your CSS animations.

6
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:13,07
They let you see what's going on in the code

7
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:17,03
behind any given CSS animation.

8
00:00:17,03 --> 00:00:20,04
Let's take a look at Firefox's tools first.

9
00:00:20,04 --> 00:00:22,08
I have one of the animations from earlier in this course

10
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:24,08
open in my Firefox browser.

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,01
To get to the animation tools,

12
00:00:26,01 --> 00:00:27,09
you need to open the web developer tools,

13
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:29,09
which you can do from the tools menu,

14
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:32,06
to browser tools and web developer tools,

15
00:00:32,06 --> 00:00:35,00
or you can use the keyboard shortcut.

16
00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:37,02
Depending on the layout of your web developer tools,

17
00:00:37,02 --> 00:00:38,09
you may need to go to this arrow

18
00:00:38,09 --> 00:00:40,04
and make sure animations is checked

19
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:42,09
to be able to see it in this right-hand pane.

20
00:00:42,09 --> 00:00:44,05
And I'll also make mine just a little bit bigger

21
00:00:44,05 --> 00:00:48,02
so I can see all the sections at once.

22
00:00:48,02 --> 00:00:49,08
The details in this tab will only show up

23
00:00:49,08 --> 00:00:52,01
once an element or elements have played their animation,

24
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:53,06
so you might need to refresh your page

25
00:00:53,06 --> 00:00:55,04
to get them to show up.

26
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:57,04
Once I do, you'll see that my animations pane

27
00:00:57,04 --> 00:00:58,08
has been populated,

28
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:02,03
and we can see the element that an animation is applied to.

29
00:01:02,03 --> 00:01:04,05
We can see the name of the animation

30
00:01:04,05 --> 00:01:06,08
and some general information about it here.

31
00:01:06,08 --> 00:01:09,00
And in this bottom pane, we can see more information

32
00:01:09,00 --> 00:01:11,04
around which property is being transformed,

33
00:01:11,04 --> 00:01:13,09
and we can even hover over each individual keyframe

34
00:01:13,09 --> 00:01:15,09
to get the values of that property

35
00:01:15,09 --> 00:01:18,02
at each of these keyframes.

36
00:01:18,02 --> 00:01:20,04
And if you don't see this lower pane initially,

37
00:01:20,04 --> 00:01:23,08
you can just click on that top listing of the animation.

38
00:01:23,08 --> 00:01:26,03
From here, we can also scrub through the animation

39
00:01:26,03 --> 00:01:28,04
and we can even have it play at different speeds,

40
00:01:28,04 --> 00:01:30,04
either very slow or very fast.

41
00:01:30,04 --> 00:01:32,07
And I find that playing animations in slow motion

42
00:01:32,07 --> 00:01:40,06
can be especially useful for debugging them.

43
00:01:40,06 --> 00:01:41,07
One last thing to point out

44
00:01:41,07 --> 00:01:43,05
that we'll see in the middle pane

45
00:01:43,05 --> 00:01:46,00
when we have the animating element selected,

46
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:46,08
and I'll just refresh

47
00:01:46,08 --> 00:01:49,04
so we get our animations populated again,

48
00:01:49,04 --> 00:01:51,05
is the easing editor right here.

49
00:01:51,05 --> 00:01:52,08
So on this little gray icon,

50
00:01:52,08 --> 00:01:55,01
we can open the timing function editor,

51
00:01:55,01 --> 00:01:56,00
and this will let us play

52
00:01:56,00 --> 00:01:57,08
with different cubic-beizer easing options

53
00:01:57,08 --> 00:01:59,02
right within our browser,

54
00:01:59,02 --> 00:02:01,05
so that's a pretty neat tool as well.

55
00:02:01,05 --> 00:02:03,01
And this tool can be especially helpful

56
00:02:03,01 --> 00:02:05,00
when you're trying to get the easing just right

57
00:02:05,00 --> 00:02:07,06
for a particular animation.

58
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:10,02
So that's a look at the animation tools in Firefox.

59
00:02:10,02 --> 00:02:12,01
Let's take a look at the ones we have available to us

60
00:02:12,01 --> 00:02:14,05
in Chrome as well.

61
00:02:14,05 --> 00:02:17,00
I have this same animation open in Chrome now,

62
00:02:17,00 --> 00:02:18,07
and to get to the Chrome developer tools,

63
00:02:18,07 --> 00:02:24,06
we want to go to view, developer, and developer tools.

64
00:02:24,06 --> 00:02:26,09
To open up the animation specific pane,

65
00:02:26,09 --> 00:02:30,02
you need to go to this three dots menu on the right,

66
00:02:30,02 --> 00:02:33,03
go to more tools,

67
00:02:33,03 --> 00:02:34,06
and then animations,

68
00:02:34,06 --> 00:02:37,00
and you'll get the animation pane opening up below.

69
00:02:37,00 --> 00:02:39,06
I'm going to make my dev tools just a bit bigger

70
00:02:39,06 --> 00:02:42,03
so we can see what's going on.

71
00:02:42,03 --> 00:02:44,03
The first thing you'll see is a message saying

72
00:02:44,03 --> 00:02:45,08
listening for animations,

73
00:02:45,08 --> 00:02:47,04
and you'll need to trigger your animations

74
00:02:47,04 --> 00:02:49,03
with this panel open to inspect them.

75
00:02:49,03 --> 00:02:52,05
So I'll refresh the page

76
00:02:52,05 --> 00:02:54,08
and now we'll see a little thumbnail

77
00:02:54,08 --> 00:02:56,06
which represents our animation.

78
00:02:56,06 --> 00:02:58,00
So we can click on that thumbnail

79
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:00,09
to see the animation that it captured.

80
00:03:00,09 --> 00:03:03,04
If you have multiple animations going on on your page,

81
00:03:03,04 --> 00:03:05,02
you might see multiple thumbnails,

82
00:03:05,02 --> 00:03:08,08
but we only have one animation so we only see one thumbnail.

83
00:03:08,08 --> 00:03:10,07
Clicking on the thumbnail opens up the timeline

84
00:03:10,07 --> 00:03:12,03
for that particular animation.

85
00:03:12,03 --> 00:03:16,05
And we can see things like its name, its overall duration,

86
00:03:16,05 --> 00:03:21,02
the placement of the keyframes and the easing used.

87
00:03:21,02 --> 00:03:23,02
We can also play and pause animation

88
00:03:23,02 --> 00:03:25,04
or have it play back at different speeds

89
00:03:25,04 --> 00:03:36,04
just like we saw in the Firefox Inspector.

90
00:03:36,04 --> 00:03:38,05
In the Chrome Inspector, we can also do things

91
00:03:38,05 --> 00:03:41,00
like move the keyframes around in time.

92
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:43,07
But note that any changes you make in this Inspector

93
00:03:43,07 --> 00:03:45,04
will not be saved anywhere.

94
00:03:45,04 --> 00:03:47,00
So you'll want to make note of any changes

95
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:48,09
you make in this panel.

96
00:03:48,09 --> 00:03:51,07
Chrome also has a handy easing editor that you can access

97
00:03:51,07 --> 00:03:54,05
from the elements property listing.

98
00:03:54,05 --> 00:03:57,02
Look for this dark gray icon next to any easing assignment

99
00:03:57,02 --> 00:03:59,07
to open the cubic-bezier editor.

100
00:03:59,07 --> 00:04:01,06
And you'll see some very similar functionality

101
00:04:01,06 --> 00:04:03,07
to what we saw in the Firefox editor,

102
00:04:03,07 --> 00:04:06,00
where we can look through some easing presets,

103
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:09,02
see a little preview and even adjust the handles ourselves

104
00:04:09,02 --> 00:04:12,09
to create custom easing right here in our browser.

105
00:04:12,09 --> 00:04:15,06
Both of these animation inspectors are hugely helpful

106
00:04:15,06 --> 00:04:18,02
for debugging and designing web animation.

107
00:04:18,02 --> 00:04:19,07
They've saved me a lot of headaches

108
00:04:19,07 --> 00:04:22,02
when animations just weren't playing back as expected

109
00:04:22,02 --> 00:04:25,00
and I'm sure there'll be just as helpful for you too.
