00:00:00,04 --> 00:00:01,06
- [Ray] This is Ray Villalobos,

2
00:00:01,06 --> 00:00:03,09
Senior Staff Instructor at LinkedIn Learning,

3
00:00:03,09 --> 00:00:05,03
and I'm going to show you how to work

4
00:00:05,03 --> 00:00:09,02
with LinkedIn Learning courses using GitHub Codespaces.

5
00:00:09,02 --> 00:00:11,08
Codespaces is a code editor in the cloud

6
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:15,00
with the full power of Visual Studio Code.

7
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:17,05
It allows for real world, hands-on practice

8
00:00:17,05 --> 00:00:20,07
that mirrors software development in the workplace.

9
00:00:20,07 --> 00:00:24,05
This course was created using GitHub Codespaces.

10
00:00:24,05 --> 00:00:27,07
Using Codespaces, you have everything you need to get going

11
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:31,05
without needing complex installations or build tools.

12
00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:34,04
One click and you're ready to go.

13
00:00:34,04 --> 00:00:35,07
First, make sure you've signed up

14
00:00:35,07 --> 00:00:38,07
for a free GitHub account and that you've logged in.

15
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:41,06
You just see your profile icon right here.

16
00:00:41,06 --> 00:00:44,00
When you go to the repository for one of our courses,

17
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:49,08
look for the Code button.

18
00:00:49,08 --> 00:00:52,01
Click on Create codespace.

19
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:53,09
The first time you open up a codespace,

20
00:00:53,09 --> 00:00:58,06
it might take a few minutes to create the virtual machine.

21
00:00:58,06 --> 00:01:02,00
Once it's done, you'll enter the code editor environment.

22
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:04,03
If you're familiar with Visual Studio Code,

23
00:01:04,03 --> 00:01:05,06
this is a special version

24
00:01:05,06 --> 00:01:09,00
of that editor running on GitHub's servers.

25
00:01:09,00 --> 00:01:10,07
The cloud editor's menu lives

26
00:01:10,07 --> 00:01:14,02
in a hamburger icon inside the activity bar.

27
00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:16,05
The menu will let you see the keyboard shortcuts

28
00:01:16,05 --> 00:01:18,01
for your operating system.

29
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:21,01
Let's find the shortcut for the Command Palette.

30
00:01:21,01 --> 00:01:23,07
Look in the hamburger menu, under View,

31
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:25,04
and then look for the keyboard shortcut

32
00:01:25,04 --> 00:01:28,09
for your operating system.

33
00:01:28,09 --> 00:01:31,08
The activity bar has the most common tools you'll need

34
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:33,07
to work with projects.

35
00:01:33,07 --> 00:01:38,08
You can, for example, show or hide the Explorer,

36
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:41,08
do a search and replace for content,

37
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:46,04
manage features of the repository, and much more.

38
00:01:46,04 --> 00:01:49,05
By the way, if for any reason you lose the activity bar,

39
00:01:49,05 --> 00:01:56,01
you can get it back using the Command Palette.

40
00:01:56,01 --> 00:01:57,02
Your course can have one

41
00:01:57,02 --> 00:01:59,04
or more extensions pre-installed,

42
00:01:59,04 --> 00:02:01,02
based on the course you're taking.

43
00:02:01,02 --> 00:02:07,06
Those can be found in the Extensions panel.

44
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:08,09
Because this is a browser,

45
00:02:08,09 --> 00:02:12,00
it's easy to inadvertently close the browser window

46
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:13,06
and lose the editor.

47
00:02:13,06 --> 00:02:15,05
If you do that, don't panic.

48
00:02:15,05 --> 00:02:17,07
Codespaces saves everything you're doing

49
00:02:17,07 --> 00:02:19,03
on a virtual machine.

50
00:02:19,03 --> 00:02:21,02
You can always get the codespace back

51
00:02:21,02 --> 00:02:24,04
for this repo by going to the Code menu

52
00:02:24,04 --> 00:02:32,02
and finding your codespace right here.

53
00:02:32,02 --> 00:02:33,08
Notice that it even remembered

54
00:02:33,08 --> 00:02:36,08
that I had opened the Extensions panel.

55
00:02:36,08 --> 00:02:37,08
This is a sample

56
00:02:37,08 --> 00:02:40,02
of what a multi-branch repository looks like,

57
00:02:40,02 --> 00:02:41,08
which is more common when you're working

58
00:02:41,08 --> 00:02:43,00
with web frameworks.

59
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:45,07
If you go to the Branch icon on the status bar,

60
00:02:45,07 --> 00:02:48,08
you can see that there's more than one branch.

61
00:02:48,08 --> 00:02:52,00
You can switch to the different branches using this menu.

62
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:53,09
The branches are named with the chapter

63
00:02:53,09 --> 00:02:56,05
and the video number you're watching.

64
00:02:56,05 --> 00:02:58,05
If you see a b at the end of the branch,

65
00:02:58,05 --> 00:03:00,09
that's how the the code looked at the beginning.

66
00:03:00,09 --> 00:03:04,02
If you see an e, that's how the code looked at the end.

67
00:03:04,02 --> 00:03:07,05
Let's switch to how the code looked on chapter two

68
00:03:07,05 --> 00:03:10,01
and the third video.

69
00:03:10,01 --> 00:03:13,01
I'll choose the beginning branch.

70
00:03:13,01 --> 00:03:14,03
As you work through a course,

71
00:03:14,03 --> 00:03:17,01
you might make some changes on a branch.

72
00:03:17,01 --> 00:03:18,07
I'm going to make a minor edit

73
00:03:18,07 --> 00:03:25,06
on the index.html file right here.

74
00:03:25,06 --> 00:03:27,06
I'm going to go ahead and save that, and you can see

75
00:03:27,06 --> 00:03:29,06
that I've modified this file,

76
00:03:29,06 --> 00:03:31,08
because there's an M right here

77
00:03:31,08 --> 00:03:36,00
and the branch name now has an asterisk on it.

78
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:38,05
If I try to switch to another branch

79
00:03:38,05 --> 00:03:41,08
that causes major changes,

80
00:03:41,08 --> 00:03:44,07
like, say, 0703e,

81
00:03:44,07 --> 00:03:48,00
I may see a dialog box like this.

82
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:49,09
If you don't care about saving your changes,

83
00:03:49,09 --> 00:03:52,08
you can simply hit the Force Checkout button.

84
00:03:52,08 --> 00:03:55,08
It will let you switch to that branch.

85
00:03:55,08 --> 00:04:01,03
You can then choose to discard the changes on this file.

86
00:04:01,03 --> 00:04:03,04
Forking lets you create your own copy

87
00:04:03,04 --> 00:04:05,07
of the repository on your account,

88
00:04:05,07 --> 00:04:08,01
so that you can keep any changes that you've made,

89
00:04:08,01 --> 00:04:10,07
even if you've deleted the codespace.

90
00:04:10,07 --> 00:04:12,00
To create your own fork,

91
00:04:12,00 --> 00:04:17,03
you can click on the Fork button on the repository.

92
00:04:17,03 --> 00:04:21,07
I'm going to hit Create fork.

93
00:04:21,07 --> 00:04:24,09
I now have my own copy of this repository,

94
00:04:24,09 --> 00:04:33,04
and if I want to, I can start a new codespace on that fork.

95
00:04:33,04 --> 00:04:35,07
This fork version is almost exactly

96
00:04:35,07 --> 00:04:37,08
like the original repository,

97
00:04:37,08 --> 00:04:40,05
but it will let you push your own changes.

98
00:04:40,05 --> 00:04:44,08
Notice that the URL of the repository is slightly different.

99
00:04:44,08 --> 00:04:46,06
Let's go ahead and make a simple change

100
00:04:46,06 --> 00:04:54,09
to this file right here.

101
00:04:54,09 --> 00:04:57,06
I'm going to save it.

102
00:04:57,06 --> 00:04:59,06
You'll note that there's an M right here,

103
00:04:59,06 --> 00:05:03,02
as well as an asterisk on this branch.

104
00:05:03,02 --> 00:05:04,06
In the Source Control panel,

105
00:05:04,06 --> 00:05:08,08
you can also see a one for the change that we just made.

106
00:05:08,08 --> 00:05:14,03
Let's go ahead and try to commit this change.

107
00:05:14,03 --> 00:05:16,06
I'm going to hit the Commit button,

108
00:05:16,06 --> 00:05:22,08
and I'll ask it to go ahead and stage the changes,

109
00:05:22,08 --> 00:05:25,07
and then I'm going to hit this button here to commit this

110
00:05:25,07 --> 00:05:30,02
onto my own version of the repo.

111
00:05:30,02 --> 00:05:32,06
I'll hit OK.

112
00:05:32,06 --> 00:05:35,04
You can also let it go ahead and run git fetch.

113
00:05:35,04 --> 00:05:39,05
That way it'll automatically sync with your forked repo.

114
00:05:39,05 --> 00:05:40,08
Now that change will be stored

115
00:05:40,08 --> 00:05:44,01
in your own version of this repository.

116
00:05:44,01 --> 00:05:46,03
Don't worry if you forget to fork a repo

117
00:05:46,03 --> 00:05:48,04
and then try to push changes.

118
00:05:48,04 --> 00:05:50,02
Codespaces will also ask you

119
00:05:50,02 --> 00:05:53,07
if you want to create a fork automatically.

120
00:05:53,07 --> 00:05:55,02
Some courses will let you work

121
00:05:55,02 --> 00:05:58,00
with live previews or create other ports

122
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:01,01
so that you can have a web view of what you're doing.

123
00:06:01,01 --> 00:06:04,07
This is managed through the Ports panel in the status bar.

124
00:06:04,07 --> 00:06:08,01
Right now, there are no ports forwarded,

125
00:06:08,01 --> 00:06:15,06
but if I open up the Live Server extension,

126
00:06:15,06 --> 00:06:18,06
you can see a preview of that file.

127
00:06:18,06 --> 00:06:21,06
Now, if we go back to the codespace to manage ports,

128
00:06:21,06 --> 00:06:25,00
you can click on the icon in the status bar

129
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:28,02
and take a look at the currently available ports.

130
00:06:28,02 --> 00:06:29,09
If you want to open this up in a browser,

131
00:06:29,09 --> 00:06:32,00
you can click right here.

132
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:34,01
Look for additional course specific tips

133
00:06:34,01 --> 00:06:35,05
from the instructor.

134
00:06:35,05 --> 00:07:32,00
Now, let's get back to the course.
