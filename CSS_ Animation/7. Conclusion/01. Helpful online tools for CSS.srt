00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,01
- [Val] The web design community is full

2
00:00:02,01 --> 00:00:03,01
of helpful people.

3
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:04,02
And because of that,

4
00:00:04,02 --> 00:00:05,09
we've got a lot of great online tools

5
00:00:05,09 --> 00:00:09,00
to help you create CSS animation.

6
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:11,04
We've touched on some of these tools throughout the course,

7
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:14,08
and now we'll look at them all in one place.

8
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:17,00
For custom or expanded easing options,

9
00:00:17,00 --> 00:00:20,02
cubic-bezier.com and easings.net have you covered.

10
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:21,05
On cubic-bezier.com,

11
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:24,04
you can edit the handles and adjust to your own curve

12
00:00:24,04 --> 00:00:26,03
and even preview it right here on the site,

13
00:00:26,03 --> 00:00:30,00
as well as copy and paste it for use in your own work.

14
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:31,08
Easings.net lets you preview a number

15
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:33,07
of commonly used easing equations,

16
00:00:33,07 --> 00:00:36,01
including the power equations or Penner's equations

17
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:37,07
as they're sometimes called.

18
00:00:37,07 --> 00:00:40,01
You can preview each of these to see how they look

19
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:43,09
and also copy the CSS for use in your own work.

20
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:46,06
For optimizing your SVGs before animating them,

21
00:00:46,06 --> 00:00:50,02
svgomg is my go-to SVG optimization tool.

22
00:00:50,02 --> 00:00:51,07
This is the browser-based version

23
00:00:51,07 --> 00:00:54,00
and you can also use other formats of it as well,

24
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:56,01
but this one is my favorite.

25
00:00:56,01 --> 00:00:57,06
And speaking of SVG,

26
00:00:57,06 --> 00:01:00,03
if you want to do more extensive SVG animation,

27
00:01:00,03 --> 00:01:01,07
I highly recommend using

28
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:04,04
the JavaScript animation library, GreenSock.

29
00:01:04,04 --> 00:01:06,06
They have specialized plugins for SVG

30
00:01:06,06 --> 00:01:08,07
like Draw SVG and Morph SVG

31
00:01:08,07 --> 00:01:11,03
that can save you a whole lot of time.

32
00:01:11,03 --> 00:01:13,07
Overall, I think it's the best animation library out there

33
00:01:13,07 --> 00:01:16,08
to work with SVG animation right now.

34
00:01:16,08 --> 00:01:19,08
If you're looking for some ready-made CSS animations

35
00:01:19,08 --> 00:01:21,03
to jumpstart a project,

36
00:01:21,03 --> 00:01:24,08
the next three sites are all great places to start for that.

37
00:01:24,08 --> 00:01:30,00
Animate.css and animxyz.com feature an extensive collection

38
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:32,07
of ready to use CSS animation effects.

39
00:01:32,07 --> 00:01:35,02
You can use them out of the box or build off them

40
00:01:35,02 --> 00:01:36,08
to create your own animation effects

41
00:01:36,08 --> 00:01:39,08
like you've learned in this course.

42
00:01:39,08 --> 00:01:42,05
Animistic.net is similar to those last two,

43
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:45,04
but it also has a robust customization visualizer,

44
00:01:45,04 --> 00:01:47,06
which can be really useful for learning

45
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:51,06
in addition to customizing the effect you want.

46
00:01:51,06 --> 00:01:52,09
And last but not least,

47
00:01:52,09 --> 00:01:55,01
browsing codepen.io is a great place

48
00:01:55,01 --> 00:01:57,03
to find CSS animation inspiration,

49
00:01:57,03 --> 00:02:00,05
and pick up on some new coding techniques.

50
00:02:00,05 --> 00:02:02,04
I hope you'll find all of these sites useful

51
00:02:02,04 --> 00:02:04,00
in your CSS animation work.
