00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,03
- [Instructor] Whether you're planning

2
00:00:01,03 --> 00:00:04,09
to use CSS or JavaScript to animate your SVG in the end,

3
00:00:04,09 --> 00:00:07,03
you'll want to make sure your SVG file is set up

4
00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:10,03
in a way that's going to be good for animation.

5
00:00:10,03 --> 00:00:12,07
There are many ways to draw shapes in SVG,

6
00:00:12,07 --> 00:00:15,01
and your ability to animate the shapes you see

7
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:19,02
in a particular graphic depend on how the SVG was drawn.

8
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:20,09
It's useful to take a look to make sure

9
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:23,08
you have the pieces you need to animate.

10
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:26,05
That could save you a lot of headaches later.

11
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:28,05
The first thing you'll want to do is look

12
00:00:28,05 --> 00:00:31,01
for distinct whole objects that you could translate,

13
00:00:31,01 --> 00:00:34,01
rotate, or scale within the SVG.

14
00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:36,06
I have an example SVG here from Undraw

15
00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:38,06
that we can use as an example.

16
00:00:38,06 --> 00:00:41,02
To inspect the SVG a little more closely,

17
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:43,06
I opened it in my vector editor of choice.

18
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:45,00
For me, that's XD,

19
00:00:45,00 --> 00:00:48,03
but you can do this in any vector editing software.

20
00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:50,05
So for example, as I click around the layers,

21
00:00:50,05 --> 00:00:53,02
I can see that this check mark is an independent object,

22
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:55,03
so if I wanted to animate that I could,

23
00:00:55,03 --> 00:00:58,00
and the square behind it is as well.

24
00:00:58,00 --> 00:01:00,01
And those are probably two of the things I would animate

25
00:01:00,01 --> 00:01:02,03
if I was animating this illustration.

26
00:01:02,03 --> 00:01:03,08
So those are looking good,

27
00:01:03,08 --> 00:01:06,04
but it is possible for things to look like separate shapes,

28
00:01:06,04 --> 00:01:08,05
but not actually be separate shapes.

29
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:12,00
For example, if I wanted to animate the kind of body

30
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:14,02
of this avatar and head of this avatar,

31
00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:17,01
I can't because they are actually together in one path.

32
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:19,09
And we can tell because when I go to move one of them,

33
00:01:19,09 --> 00:01:21,00
both of them move,

34
00:01:21,00 --> 00:01:24,06
and they are both part of this path called path 198.

35
00:01:24,06 --> 00:01:26,09
So if I wanted to animate those separately,

36
00:01:26,09 --> 00:01:29,08
I would need to edit this illustration further

37
00:01:29,08 --> 00:01:31,03
to separate that path,

38
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:33,04
or possibly find a different illustration

39
00:01:33,04 --> 00:01:34,09
that has those things separated out

40
00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:38,02
depending on what I wanted to do.

41
00:01:38,02 --> 00:01:41,03
In this case, I know I only want to animate the checkboxes

42
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,07
and that big rectangle behind those avatars,

43
00:01:43,07 --> 00:01:46,00
so I know I'll be fine.

44
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:48,02
My second tip for checking your SVG

45
00:01:48,02 --> 00:01:50,04
is to name the layers or the paths,

46
00:01:50,04 --> 00:01:52,02
depending on how your file is set up,

47
00:01:52,02 --> 00:01:56,02
that you'll be animating so it's easier to find them later.

48
00:01:56,02 --> 00:02:00,06
To animate an SVG, we need to have it inline in our HTML.

49
00:02:00,06 --> 00:02:03,03
If we name the shapes we plan to use in our animation,

50
00:02:03,03 --> 00:02:05,00
it will be a lot easier to find them

51
00:02:05,00 --> 00:02:07,00
and target them with CSS rules

52
00:02:07,00 --> 00:02:09,01
when we're writing the animations.

53
00:02:09,01 --> 00:02:11,02
So I'll go back to XD,

54
00:02:11,02 --> 00:02:17,03
and I'm going to name this first check, check1,

55
00:02:17,03 --> 00:02:22,03
and this box, maybe checkbox1,

56
00:02:22,03 --> 00:02:26,08
and I'll do the same for the second box,

57
00:02:26,08 --> 00:02:29,06
and the second check mark.

58
00:02:29,06 --> 00:02:32,06
And I think you're getting the idea here.

59
00:02:32,06 --> 00:02:34,02
I'll go through the rest of my layers now

60
00:02:34,02 --> 00:02:36,03
and make sure that everything I'm planning on using

61
00:02:36,03 --> 00:02:39,05
in my animation has a name so I can find it later.

62
00:02:39,05 --> 00:02:40,09
You don't need to worry about naming

63
00:02:40,09 --> 00:02:42,06
every single object though,

64
00:02:42,06 --> 00:02:45,09
just the ones you know you'll want to use in your animation.

65
00:02:45,09 --> 00:02:49,02
Most SVG illustrations have a whole lot of elements in them,

66
00:02:49,02 --> 00:02:50,05
far more than you'll want to take

67
00:02:50,05 --> 00:02:52,00
the time to name individually,

68
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:53,05
especially if you're not going to use

69
00:02:53,05 --> 00:02:56,00
all of those objects in your animation.
