00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,08
- [Instructor] To animate your SVG

2
00:00:01,08 --> 00:00:04,03
you'll need to have an inline in your HTML,

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:06,03
so you'll want to take a slightly different approach

4
00:00:06,03 --> 00:00:09,07
to exporting and optimizing it than you might otherwise.

5
00:00:09,07 --> 00:00:11,00
You'll want the code to be readable

6
00:00:11,00 --> 00:00:14,05
and manageable while you're working on your animation.

7
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:15,08
Different vector editing tools

8
00:00:15,08 --> 00:00:19,00
serve as different levels of options for exporting SVGs,

9
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:20,04
so you might see different options

10
00:00:20,04 --> 00:00:22,05
depending on the tool you're using.

11
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:25,09
The main things you'll have options for when exporting SVG

12
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:27,01
are a choice between

13
00:00:27,01 --> 00:00:30,00
presentation attributes or internal CSS,

14
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:33,04
a choice between linked images or embedded images,

15
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:36,08
and the option to minify the SVG file.

16
00:00:36,08 --> 00:00:38,07
Let's look at each of these options more closely

17
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:42,01
to see what they mean for our exported code.

18
00:00:42,01 --> 00:00:44,03
That first option on my list lets you choose

19
00:00:44,03 --> 00:00:45,03
whether you prefer to have

20
00:00:45,03 --> 00:00:48,04
your SVG's fill and stroke attributes displayed in CSS

21
00:00:48,04 --> 00:00:49,09
at the top of your file

22
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:55,00
or as presentation attributes directly on the SVG elements.

23
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:57,06
The choice here is mostly up to personal preference.

24
00:00:57,06 --> 00:00:59,06
Both are flexible in similar ways

25
00:00:59,06 --> 00:01:02,00
and it just kind of comes down to what you prefer

26
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:05,06
or what's most useful for the way you tend to work.

27
00:01:05,06 --> 00:01:07,07
If you choose the CSS option,

28
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:10,09
you'll get a block like this at the top of your SVG file.

29
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:12,05
This makes for an easy central place

30
00:01:12,05 --> 00:01:15,00
to make changes to your strokes and fills as needed

31
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:16,08
and you can copy and paste the CSS

32
00:01:16,08 --> 00:01:20,00
directly into your CSS file as well.

33
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:21,02
This is my preferred option.

34
00:01:21,02 --> 00:01:24,00
But like I said, it's really up to personal preference.

35
00:01:24,00 --> 00:01:26,03
If you select presentation attributes,

36
00:01:26,03 --> 00:01:28,06
that same information that's in the CSS

37
00:01:28,06 --> 00:01:31,07
will instead be attributes on the elements themselves.

38
00:01:31,07 --> 00:01:35,03
So for example, this path has the fill set directly on it

39
00:01:35,03 --> 00:01:40,05
as opposed to in a block of CSS at the top of the SVG file.

40
00:01:40,05 --> 00:01:42,03
Next on the list is the question

41
00:01:42,03 --> 00:01:45,00
of linked or embedded images.

42
00:01:45,00 --> 00:01:46,07
Personally I rarely have images

43
00:01:46,07 --> 00:01:49,06
embedded in my SVG files that I'm animating.

44
00:01:49,06 --> 00:01:50,07
But if you do,

45
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:52,09
it's important to know that choosing embed here

46
00:01:52,09 --> 00:01:55,00
will result in a higher file size,

47
00:01:55,00 --> 00:01:57,06
so link is generally the best choice.

48
00:01:57,06 --> 00:02:00,02
Linked images will also give you a greater flexibility

49
00:02:00,02 --> 00:02:04,07
to change the image without re-exporting the entire SVG.

50
00:02:04,07 --> 00:02:06,01
The biggest one to look out for

51
00:02:06,01 --> 00:02:09,03
is the last one on my list about minifying.

52
00:02:09,03 --> 00:02:11,01
Minifying your SVG might sound

53
00:02:11,01 --> 00:02:13,01
like a good idea for file size,

54
00:02:13,01 --> 00:02:14,08
but you'll want to keep the code

55
00:02:14,08 --> 00:02:16,08
human-readable while you're animating,

56
00:02:16,08 --> 00:02:20,08
and minified code is pretty impossible to read.

57
00:02:20,08 --> 00:02:22,06
You can always modify the file later

58
00:02:22,06 --> 00:02:24,06
once your animation is finalized,

59
00:02:24,06 --> 00:02:26,07
but I highly recommend not minifying

60
00:02:26,07 --> 00:02:30,04
while you're in the process of working on your animation.

61
00:02:30,04 --> 00:02:31,04
With all that in mind,

62
00:02:31,04 --> 00:02:35,01
I'll head to XD to export my SVG file from the last video.

63
00:02:35,01 --> 00:02:36,01
So I will go here.

64
00:02:36,01 --> 00:02:44,09
I'm going to do File, Export, and Selected.

65
00:02:44,09 --> 00:02:45,08
And as I said,

66
00:02:45,08 --> 00:02:47,07
I'm going to select Internal CSS.

67
00:02:47,07 --> 00:02:49,04
I'm going to select linked images

68
00:02:49,04 --> 00:02:51,07
even though it doesn't matter for this particular one

69
00:02:51,07 --> 00:02:53,02
'cause I have no images

70
00:02:53,02 --> 00:02:56,01
and I'm going to leave the minify unchecked.

71
00:02:56,01 --> 00:02:57,09
I'll export my SVG

72
00:02:57,09 --> 00:02:59,05
and then we'll move on to our next step

73
00:02:59,05 --> 00:03:02,01
of optimizing that SVG.

74
00:03:02,01 --> 00:03:04,07
Optimizing your SVG after you've exported it

75
00:03:04,07 --> 00:03:05,06
is a good next step

76
00:03:05,06 --> 00:03:08,06
because optimizing can lead to better performance.

77
00:03:08,06 --> 00:03:10,09
My current SVG optimizer of choice

78
00:03:10,09 --> 00:03:13,07
is Jake Archibald's SVGOMG.

79
00:03:13,07 --> 00:03:16,00
I like that it's easy to access in the browser

80
00:03:16,00 --> 00:03:17,07
and it lets you switch between the code

81
00:03:17,07 --> 00:03:19,03
and image preview views

82
00:03:19,03 --> 00:03:21,03
so you can make sure your optimizations

83
00:03:21,03 --> 00:03:25,05
aren't adversely affecting any visual things in your SVG.

84
00:03:25,05 --> 00:03:27,05
Once I'm here, I can upload my SVG

85
00:03:27,05 --> 00:03:30,01
just by dragging and dropping it on the site,

86
00:03:30,01 --> 00:03:34,00
and you'll see my SVG just like we saw in XD.

87
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:35,08
There are some default optimizations

88
00:03:35,08 --> 00:03:37,04
already made for us here

89
00:03:37,04 --> 00:03:39,08
and I'm not going to go through every option here.

90
00:03:39,08 --> 00:03:41,00
But there are a couple of settings

91
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:42,04
you'll want to watch out for

92
00:03:42,04 --> 00:03:45,04
when you're optimizing for animation.

93
00:03:45,04 --> 00:03:49,00
The first is this one, Shapes to smaller paths.

94
00:03:49,00 --> 00:03:51,00
Small is generally better when you're looking

95
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:52,04
to save file size

96
00:03:52,04 --> 00:03:54,03
but this setting may fundamentally change

97
00:03:54,03 --> 00:03:57,00
the nature of the objects in your SVG,

98
00:03:57,00 --> 00:03:59,09
and that can make them harder to target for animation.

99
00:03:59,09 --> 00:04:01,08
So use this one with caution.

100
00:04:01,08 --> 00:04:04,06
If your animation relies on having things like circles

101
00:04:04,06 --> 00:04:06,04
and rectangles in your SVG,

102
00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:07,08
you'll want to turn this off

103
00:04:07,08 --> 00:04:09,02
because it will turn those circles

104
00:04:09,02 --> 00:04:12,01
and rectangles into paths.

105
00:04:12,01 --> 00:04:14,00
In many cases that won't make a difference,

106
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:18,02
but it's one to look out for just in case it does for you.

107
00:04:18,02 --> 00:04:21,03
The same goes for this Merge paths option.

108
00:04:21,03 --> 00:04:23,08
If you're planning to animate any of your paths,

109
00:04:23,08 --> 00:04:25,06
double check that this setting doesn't merge

110
00:04:25,06 --> 00:04:27,02
any paths you need to keep separate

111
00:04:27,02 --> 00:04:29,06
before going through with the optimization.

112
00:04:29,06 --> 00:04:32,04
Merged paths generally means fewer paths.

113
00:04:32,04 --> 00:04:35,03
But if you needed those individual paths to animate them,

114
00:04:35,03 --> 00:04:37,07
that could be a problem.

115
00:04:37,07 --> 00:04:39,01
You'll also want to keep an eye

116
00:04:39,01 --> 00:04:41,05
on this Round or rewrite paths.

117
00:04:41,05 --> 00:04:44,00
Keeping this turned on is usually fine,

118
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:46,08
but it can cause distortions in the shapes of an SVG

119
00:04:46,08 --> 00:04:51,00
especially if that SVG is drawn at a very small size.

120
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:51,08
Most of the time,

121
00:04:51,08 --> 00:04:53,09
the default settings are exactly what you need

122
00:04:53,09 --> 00:04:56,03
and everything looks good both visually

123
00:04:56,03 --> 00:04:58,08
and in the Markup tab.

124
00:04:58,08 --> 00:05:00,02
Once you've got your settings in place

125
00:05:00,02 --> 00:05:01,09
and everything looks good to you,

126
00:05:01,09 --> 00:05:05,01
you can either download your SVG using the Download button

127
00:05:05,01 --> 00:05:07,01
or you can go to the Markup tab

128
00:05:07,01 --> 00:05:09,01
and copy and paste the code of your SVG

129
00:05:09,01 --> 00:05:11,03
directly into your project.

130
00:05:11,03 --> 00:05:15,00
Either way, your SVG is optimized and ready to use.
